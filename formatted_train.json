Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu identified the dead as a father and his three children, plus two other men. All were Arizona residents and knew each other well, he said. The twin-engine Rockwell 690A airplane slammed into a steep cliff near the top of the Superstition Mountains at 6:31 p.m. on Wednesday, strewing debris for hundreds of yards down the 80-degree incline, Babeu told reporters. Recovery efforts by more than 50 deputies and volunteers involved collect and preserving the remains, the sheriff said. \"No one could survive that crash,\" he said. The plane had flown from Safford to Mesa, where it picked up the siblings -- ages 9, 8 and 6 -- for the Thanksgiving holiday, Babeu said. \"All of these families are just obviously heartbroken, traumatized over the loss of their loved ones so suddenly here on Thanksgiving,\" he said. Federal officials were expected to begin their investigation as soon as Thursday, according to Babeu. A man who said he witnessed the impact told CNN that a mushroom cloud of flames lit up the evening sky. Kevin Cunningham, 44, of Apache Junction, said he was talking on the phone from his back porch and saw the crash a few miles away. \"The flames lit up the mountain,\" said Cunningham, adding the plane appeared to be flying level before the crash. \"I didn't see where it was in distress.\" CNN's Phil Gast and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.",

Exercise may hold the key to combatting some of the negative side effects that antidepressants can have on a woman\u2019s sex drive. Just 30 minutes of exercise immediately before having sex, \u2018significantly\u2019 improves sexual functioning in women taking the drugs and boosts their ability to orgasm, new research suggests. The findings could have important health implications for alleviating some side effects of antidepressants. Exercise may hold the key to combatting some of the negative side effects that antidepressants can have on a woman's sex drive, according to new research by the University of Texas . The study, published online in the journal Depression and Anxiety, shows that sexual dysfunction can be effectively treated with an inexpensive, non-invasive prescription of moderately intense workouts. \u2018These findings have important implications for public health, as exercise as a treatment for sexual side effects is accessible, cheap and does not add to burden of care,\u2019 said Tierney Lorenz, an Indiana University post-doctoral research fellow, who conducted the study at the University of Texas at Austin with psychology professor Cindy Meston. The researchers examined 52 women who reported sexual side effects from antidepressants. The study participants had sex without doing an exercise for the first three weeks of the experiment. Over another three weeks, half of the group then exercised for 30 minutes immediately before having sex and the other half did 30 minutes of strength training and cardio exercise three times a week whenever they liked. The two groups then reversed roles in the last experiment. The scientists discovered that regular exercise improved the ability of the women to orgasm. They also found that those who exercised immediately before sex experienced significantly stronger libidos and overall improvements in sexual functioning . Women who exercised regularly were asked to add three extra sessions to their workout routines and all the participants self-reported their sexual function, desires, satisfaction and psychological health before and after each part of the experiment. The scientists discovered that regular exercise improved the ability of the women to orgasm. They also found that those who exercised immediately before sex experienced significantly stronger libidos and overall improvements in sexual functioning. The researchers believe this is because moderately intense exercise activates the sympathetic nervous system, which facilitates blood flow to the genital region, while antidepressants have been shown to decrease this system. Scheduling regular sexual activity and exercise may be an effective tool for alleviating these adverse side effects, Dr Lorenz said. \u2018Considering the wide prevalence of antidepressant sexual side effects and the dearth of treatment options for those experiencing these distressing effects, this is an important step in treating sexual dysfunction among women who are taking antidepressants,\u2019 she said.

Quiet streets. Shopping malls. Or: Bored teenagers. Sterile sprawl. Endless traffic. Creepy neighbors. Festering secrets. Shopping malls. For some, the promised land. For others, a worm-infested dullsville. Why such a divide? Perhaps it's the natural reaction to disillusionment, says Syracuse pop culture professor Robert Thompson. The suburb \"was touted as the perfect way to package American life in the utopian era that we expected the end of World War II to bring us,\" he says. \"We're in the Space Age. Television comes out. Air conditioning and dishwashers and all of this stuff. The suburbs stood for the place where this perfect kind of life was going to be lived.\" The suburb wasn't a new concept; people had been attempting to push their way out of crowded cities for as long as there had been crowded cities, and rail service and streetcars made it possible to build communities on city outskirts. \"Streetcar suburbs,\" such as Atlanta's Inman Park, Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and Houston's Houston Heights, started sprouting in the 19th century. But it was the automobile, with its promise of personal mobility, that fostered a suburban boom. The most popular exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair was Norman Bel Geddes' Futurama -- sponsored by General Motors -- which posited a future of superhighways leading consumers through muscular cities and bucolic towns. \"I Have Seen The Future,\" read the souvenir buttons. CNN Photos: Bill Owens' 'Suburbia' captured the American Dream . The future originally looked something like the past. Tired of six-story walkups? In the suburbs you could have your own picket-fenced home, just like the ones in small towns of yore. Sick of the subway? In the suburbs you could ride the comfortable commuter train -- or, even better, travel to work on a speedy expressway in your very own car. Television was the best mirror of this optimistic age. Mayfield's Cleavers (\"Leave It to Beaver\"), Springfield's Andersons (\"Father Knows Best,\" less biting than the radio version) and Hilldale's Stones (\"The Donna Reed Show\") all lived in crime-free municipalities urban enough to have the latest appliances (like, well, a television) but removed enough that their kids could play and bike without those crowded city worries -- like traffic, ethnic groups and the poor. In this period, it was writers who poked holes in suburban perfection. John Cheever, with his quietly desperate New York escapees, was the master of suburban dissatisfaction, but others -- novelist Richard Yates (\"Revolutionary Road\") and journalist Vance Packard (\"The Status Seekers\") among them -- took aim at the consumerist society entwined with suburbia. On TV, only \"Twilight Zone's\" Rod Serling -- at heart, a writer -- seemed to agree with them. Eventually their views took over. If the cities were rotten -- just check out early '70s films such as \"The French Connection\" and \"Shaft\" for a taste of the chipping paint -- the suburbs were soulless, cookie-cutter places inhabited by people with secrets. Southern California, which is often depicted as one big suburb, was the center of this emptiness (it doesn't hurt that the region's chief industry is fantasy), but it's an image that transfers anywhere, from Chicago (\"Ordinary People\") to Elm Street (\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\"). Indeed, horror movies such as \"Nightmare,\" \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Poltergeist\" found plenty to work with in the suburbs. These days, the pop culture divide still holds. To some -- Woody Allen comes to mind -- the city, for all its faults, is vibrant and lively, and the suburbs are \"American Beauty\" dead ends. To others, particularly television producers, it's the suburbs -- where most of us live, after all -- where real life happens, and the city is something for the wealthy, the terminally hip, the criminals and the tourists. iReport: What makes your suburb unique? The truth, of course, is neither here nor there. Today's suburbs are increasingly multicultural and, in some cases, have developed their own skyscraper-filled \"edge cities,\" in the term popularized by journalist Joel Garreau. Accurately portraying such a complex environment is as difficult as accurately portraying the people who live there -- though there are some (author Tom Perrotta, \"My So-Called Life\" producers Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick) who try. In the end, suburbia is what our imagination wants it to be, and it won't quite fit into those little boxes of ticky-tacky. \"We know that inside each one of those identical boxes, with its Dodge parked out front, and its white bread on the table, and its TV set glowing blue in the falling dusk, there were people with stories,\" concluded the pilot of \"The Wonder Years.\" \"There were families bound together in the pain and the struggle of love. There were moments that made us cry with laughter. And there were moments ... of sorrow and wonder.\"",

The sentence issued by Summit County Court of Common Pleas Judge Mary Margaret Rowlands was in line with a prosecutor's recommendation that Wise receive a lighter punishment than the minimum 23 years on his most serious conviction, an aggravated murder count with a firearm specification. Wise's attorney, Paul Adamson, said ahead of the sentencing that they will pursue clemency from the governor no matter the punishment. County Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh had called Wise's actions illegal and dangerous but said the case warranted leniency. She had recommended that Wise be sentenced on a lesser offense, manslaughter. Neither side had found previous case law to support the prosecutor's suggestion that the judge could sentence Wise to six years for manslaughter, a charge that wasn't among the counts against him but is considered a lesser included offense.

The UK will also look at how it can play a role in getting equipment to Kurdish forces as they are better able to counter the Islamic State (IS), formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis), Number 10 added. President Barack Obama said the US had \u2018stepped up\u2019 its support to Iraqi and Kurdish forces engaged in the fight on the ground and was continuing with its daily humanitarian efforts. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who chaired a meeting of the Government\u2019s emergency Cobra committee to discuss the crisis yesterday, said the situation was \u2018challenging\u2019 and warned of a \u2018potential humanitarian disaster on a huge scale\u2019. The Department for International Development said the UK\u2019s second aid drop included 3,180 reusable water purification containers filled with 15,900 litres of clean water and 816 solar lamps that can also be used to charge mobile phones. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: \u2018The humanitarian situation in Iraq area is deeply worrying. \u2018Isis terrorists continue to contest towns and villages south of Erbil and in the Sinjar area and the Yazidi community face appalling conditions, cut off on Mount Sinjar. \u2018UK aid is already helping the people who desperately need it.

The government said the UK\u2019s second aid drop included 3,180 reusable water purification containers filled with 15,900 litres of clean water and 816 solar lamps . British voters narrowly support taking part in air strikes against Islamic State fighters sweeping through northern Iraq slaughtering non-Muslims. The Government has refused to rule out joining a US military assault to protect civilians fleeing the jihadists - but has insisted its focus is on getting aid to refugees. But a YouGov poll for the Sun has revealed support for UK troops to bomb the fanatics. The revelation comes as the RAF geared up to send Tornado jets into Iraq \u2013 but only to monitor the humanitarian situation on the ground. Some 37 per cent of Britons approve of the RAF taking part in air strikes \u2013 while 36 per cent disapprove and the remaining 27 per cent saying they don\u2019t know. Last August 50 per cent of the country was opposed to missile strikes on Syria \u2013 with just 25 per cent in support. One of Britain\u2019s most senior generals accused the \u2018commitment-phobic\u2019 Government of being \u2018terrified\u2019 of intervening in the Iraq crisis before next year\u2019s general election. General Sir Richard Shirreff told the Times: \u2018The longer we sit on our hands and prevaricate, the more dangerous the situation is going to become\u2019. But speaking after the Cobra committee meeting yesterday, Mr Hammond rejected calls for Parliament to be recalled to discuss the crisis and said there were no plans for British military involvement. \u2018We don\u2019t envisage a combat role at the present time,\u2019 he said. David Cameron, who is on holiday in Portugal, has been urged to call MPs back from their summer break to discuss the crisis and he has also faced pressure - including from former head of the Army Lord Dannatt - to consider a military intervention. Downing Street said the Prime Minister was \u2018very much engaged\u2019 with the situation despite being abroad and a recall of Parliament was \u2018not on the cards\u2019. But the Prime Minister is facing increasing pressure to join US military action against ISIS forces. Tory MP Mark Pritchard said it was time for the UK to take direct military action - through air strikes and drone attacks but not ground forces - and predicted a recalled Commons would vote in favour of the escalation. 'The international community can pour as much aid into the region as its likes,' he wrote for the PoliticsHome website. 'But unless Islamic State fighters are killed and removed from the battlefield, they will go on killing and committing further atrocities. 'The UK must not walk by on the other side and that is why overnight news that RAF Tornadoes are once again going to fly in Iraqi airspace is welcome. 'However, this intervention needs to be in an unequivocal combat role, not just in an intelligence, surveillance and targeting role.' Inaction at this stage would be 'a greater risk than positive action', he suggested. Displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect, fleeing violence from forces loyal to the Islamic State in Sinjar town, walk towards the Syrian border, on the outskirts of Sinjar mountain, near the Syrian border town of Elierbeh yesterday .

He urged the Government to support any effort to secure a United Nations Security Council resolution in support of military action. A proposed French resolution was too weak and 'in danger of being just another UN platitude whilst toddlers choke on their own blood', he said. Mr Pritchard said the different circumstances suggested there would be no repeat of MPs' refusal last year to endorse military intervention in Syria. 'I suspect this time Parliament would vote for decisive, precision, and targeted military action in Iraq, with clearly defined rules of engagement.'

But researchers have discovered that dressing felines in multi-coloured collars could drop this kill rate by 54 per cent. During tests, an anti-predation collar known as Birdsbesafe (BBS) was found to give birds more warning about an impending attack due to their advanced colour vision. Scroll down for video . The anti-predation collar cover is called Birdsbesage (BBS) and is designed to be easily spotted by birds, reptiles and amphibians - known as herpetofauna. These animals have advanced colour vision compared to mammals. During tests the collar (pictured) reduced captures by 54% in one year . The $9 collar is sold by a Vermont-based firm of the same name. It is available in yellow, red and rainbow designs and claims to \u2018save birds from cats.\u2019 Researchers from the School of Veterinary and Life Sciences at Murdoch University, Australia \u2013 led by Catherine Hall - wanted to put this collar to the test. During a two-year period, Ms Hall and her team asked cat owners to report on the number and type of prey caught by their pets. Birds can see certain light frequencies - such as ultraviolet - that humans cannot see. Many songbirds have feathers that reflect ultraviolet light to communicate and attract a mate. Both birds and humans have photoreceptive 'cones' in the retina located at the back of the eye that help the eyes see colour light. In humans, there are three types of photoreceptive cones which are sensitive to red, green, or blue, and this is called trichromatic colour vision. Birds have an additional cone for tetrachromatic colour vision. This expands the visible light spectrum. Birds also have up to 12 times the number of cones - around 120,000 cones per square millimetre - compared to humans. In the first year they studied the effectiveness of each individual colour and in the second year they concentrated on the rainbow collar. They discovered that the number of birds, reptiles and amphibians were reduced by 54 per cent across the board, but the rainbow and red BBS were more effective than the yellow. During the second year, captures were reduced by 47 per cent. However, captures of mammals such as mice and rats were not reduced significantly. The researchers said this is because birds, reptiles and amphibians have a more advanced colour vision meaning they could spot the collar more easily than animals with limited colour vision.

The skin tone is lightened and any imperfections are removed by the computer programs . The right eye is widened and its shape altered before it is copied, flipped, and used to replace the left eye . The colour and shape of her eyes, colour and style of her hair, skin tone and whiteness of her teeth are all completely altered, quite literally changing her identity. You can see skin imperfections wiped away at the click of a mouse, and artificial flattering lighting creates the kind of radiant and highlighted skin that women spend thousands trying to achieve, not realising that what they are trying to emulate does not exist in reality. Shockingly the facial shape is also altered in the video and her right eye is artificially widened before a mirror image of it is created and pasted over her real left eye to create perfect symmetry in the face. The teeth are whitened and the lips made fuller and more pink using a program specifically designed to alter parts of the face . The computer program can totally change eye colour- allowing the programer to pick from a vast colour palette . Similarly, hair style, length and colour are all easily manipulable, as if creating a doll . Once flawless eye make-up has been digitally applied and the hair 'perfected', we are left with a woman who, while she looks stunning and conforms to our beauty ideals, bears little resemblance to the real artist. Boggie chose to reveal the extent to which celebrities are altered as the video for her song which criticises modern consumerism and urges women to be themselves. The song, which is sung in French, starts with a list of brands and designers such as Prada, Hugo Boss, Chanel, Giorgio Armani, and\u00a0 Lancome, before moving onto the refrain which states, \u2018I am not a product.\u2019 The chorus declares \u2018Of beauty, preciousness; they cannot change me. Peerless, unparalleled. The new fragrance is myself\u2019 while the third verse states \u2018mascara, blush, lipstick, lipsticks, lip liners, eye shadow, foundation, nail, pressed powder and I do not want it.\u2019 Flattering lighting and perfect eye make is applied . Under the new lighting, Boogie's hair colour is once again changed, scrolling through a range of colours until the perfect shade is found . As a final touch, Boogie's hair is swept to one side and digitally made to look much thicker . The video, which has exploded across the web since its release last week, is part of a trend attempting to lift the lid on the lack of reality in celebrity culture and advertising. In October, a 36-second clip, created by GlobalDemocracy.com, showing a relatively average-looking girl turned into a bombshell glamour model, went viral, adding fuel to the ongoing debate surrounding airbrushed models and how they can set unrealistic examples to impressionable young girls. A result of this is an increasing backlash against altering images, with American Eagle being the latest brand to release a totally un-airbrushed campaign for its new line of lingerie. The debate was reopened this week surrounding the digital retouching of Lena Dunham for her Vogue photoshoot (though it was, many thought, misjudged), and increasingly, brands who overuse Photoshop are being \u2018shamed\u2019 online, with the original images obtained and released as a comparison.",

He was 81. Bishop Earl Paulk died this weekend at 81. Paulk died near midnight Saturday at the Atlanta Medical Center, a nursing supervisor confirmed to CNN. The bishop had been at the hospital for several days, she said. Paulk's death came after an \"extended and horrible battle with cancer,\" Paulk's nephew, Bishop Jim Swilley, wrote in a blog post. Paulk founded the Chapel Hill Harvester Church in Decatur, a suburb of Atlanta. It quickly grew to become one of the first megachurches in the country. Paulk also had his own television show. But his success as a preacher was overshadowed time and again by allegations of sexual impropriety. One allegation ended in a civil suit that was settled out of court in 2003. The accuser said Paulk molested her when she was a child. A second woman claimed the bishop forced her into a 14-year affair. She filed, withdrew and refiled a suit. Dennis Brewer, an attorney for Paulk, admitted to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Paulk had a brief adulterous relationship with the woman, but said she was the initiator. During a deposition in the case, the bishop said under oath the woman was the only one he slept with outside of marriage. But a court-ordered paternity test showed that he also fathered a child with his sister-in-law. Other allegations -- some true, some unfounded -- cost the church membership, as worshippers dwindled from 10,000 to about 1,000. \"As most of you know, my family has been walking through a very long nightmare season in connection with things concerning him,\" Swilley wrote in his blog post. \"Please pray for some much needed healing and closure for us all.\"",

Newly declassified documents reveal new information about the CIA's Project Azorian, a plan hatched to secretly salvage a Soviet nuclear submarine. In 1974, the CIA commissioned Howard Hughes to construct a massive vessel to recover a Soviet submarine that sank in the Pacific Ocean in 1968. Some 200 pages on Project Azorian, one of the most complex, expensive, and secretive intelligence operations of the Cold War, reveal previously unknown details of the aborted plan. Covert operation: American millionaire businessman, film director, and aviator, Howard Hughes was contracted by the CIA to build a huge vessel to secretly recover a Soviet submarine . According to io9.com, the submarine was important to the U.S. because it would enable officials to examine the design of Soviet nuclear warheads and decipher Soviet naval codes. The Soviets tried for two months to recover the sub, but the attempts were fruitless. Hughes's vessel, the Hughes Glomar Explorer, embarked on a salvage mission in 1974 which was somewhat successful. A planned follow-up mission in 1975 was aborted after the top-secret plan was leaked to the press. Afterwards, the CIA refused to comment on Project Azorian, neither confirming nor denying involvement with Hughes's vessel. In the recently published Foreign Relations of the United States volume, National Security Policy: 1973-1976, new details emerge of the plan to covertly steal the sub. According to the documents, a team of engineers designed the 618-foot, 36,000-ton recovery vessel and commissioned Howard Hughes's company the Summa Corporation to build it. In order to thwart any suspicions that could be raised by the sight of the gigantic recovery vessel, the CIA invented a story that the Hughes Glomar Explorer (HGE) was being built for a private business venture of Hughes's - mining manganese nodules from the ocean floor. The determination reached was that deep ocean mining would be particularly suitable... Mr. Howard Hughes... is recognized as a pioneering entrepreneur with a wide variety of business interests; he has the necessary financial resources; he habitually operates in secrecy; and, his personal eccentricities are such that news media reporting and speculation about his activities frequently range from the truth to utter fiction,' reads a memo from Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1974. Colossal ship: The Glomar Explorer, now used for deep sea exploration, shown tied up in Long Beach harbor . As the $800 million project continued, officials began to raise questions about whether retrieving the submarine was worth the resources being plowed into it, six years after it sank. Ultimately, a committee decide that the benefits to be gained from examining the submarine were worth the expense. In addition, the director of the CIA was concerned that canceling the project now would make the government seem 'capricious' to contractors. Another memo stated that 'provisions for handling and disposition of the target crew remains are generally in accordance with the 1949 Geneva Convention. They will be handled with due respect and returned to the ocean bottom.' In addition, any personal effects belonging to the dead crew members from the Soviet submarine would be kept to eventually returned to their families as a way to placate the Soviets if they discovered the theft of the vessel. 'Culminating six years of effort, the AZORIAN Project is ready to attempt to recover a Soviet ballistic missile submarine from 16,500 feet of water in the Pacific. 'The recovery ship would depart the west coast 15 June and arrive at the target site 29 June. Recovery operations will take 21\u201342 days (30 June to 20 July\u201310 August),' reads a memo from Kissinger. The project was given a 40 per cent change of success - apparently an optimistic estimate for ventures of the risk and difficulty that Project Azorian posed. Secrets of the deep: An aerial starboard bow view of a Soviet Golf II class ballistic missile submarine like the one that sank in the Pacific Ocean . The first salvage mission in 1974 was only partially successful after a portion of the submarine fell back into the water as it was being hauled up by the capture vessel. During this time, President Nixon had resigned and officials were unsure whether the project could remain secret for much longer. Kissinger spoke about his concerns to President Gerald Ford. 'There are so many people who have to be briefed on covert operations, it is bound to leak. There is no one with guts left. All of yesterday they were making a record to protect themselves about AZORIAN. It was a discouraging meeting. I wonder if we shouldn't get the leadership in and discuss it. Maybe there should be a Joint Committee,' he said. 'I have always fought that, but maybe we have to. It would have to be a tight group, not a big broad one,' Ford responded. 'I am really worried. We are paralyzed,' said Kissinger. In fact, the press was already onto the story, with a New York Times journalist Seymour Hersh, twice being asked by the CIA to delay publication of the story. In the end, it wasn't the Times that broke the story, it was a gaffe by the CIA itself. In 1974, Summa Corporation was broken into, and thieves stole four boxes of documents - and a memo about Project Azorian's true progenitors was missing. Soon after, LA police were contacted by a person claiming to be acting on behalf of a person in possession of the documents who wanted $500,00 for their safe return. Contractor: The CIA didn't want to put contractors like Howard Hughes offside by cancelling Project Azorian . Trying to deduce whether the thief did indeed have the missing memo, the CIA informed the FBI about it. The FBI passed on the information to police, who asked the intermediary whether the thief was in possession of it. Shortly before the second planned salvage mission, the Los Angeles Times published a report stating that 'reports circulating among local law enforcement officers' indicated Howard 'was contracted to the CIA to raise a sunken Russian nuclear submarine from the Atlantic Ocean\u2026 The operation, one investigator theorized, was carried out - or at least attempted - by the crew of a marine mining vessel owned by Hughes Summa Corp.' After that, it was a free for all and Hersh published his story - as did several other major newspapers, with the Washington Post and the New York Times making it their front page. Contrary to fears of retaliation, the Soviets did not publicly respond to the reports, hoping to play down its own failure to retrieve the submarine. The CIA was unwilling to push the Soviets any further though, believing that 'It seems beyond doubt that the Soviets would go to great lengths to frustrate or disrupt a second mission.' Eventually, Kissinger told Ford that the Soviets were stationed at the site of the submarine and would not allow a second salvage mission without a fight. The total cost of the ultimately failed mission was $800 million - which, reports io9.com, translates to about $3 billion. The Hughes Glomar Explorer was eventually repurposed to be a deep-sea driller, as per the CIA's original fictitious story and last sold to a private company for $15 million in 2010.",

Thousands of graduates crowd a jobs fair in Nanjing but vacancies are becoming harder to find. The stimulus package, unveiled earlier this month, will pump $585 billion into rebuilding communities destroyed by the May earthquake, constructing railways, housing, airports and highways, and funding other projects. China is most concerned about the growing labor unrest, the human resources minister, Yin Weimin, said at a news conference. The increase in unrest has paralleled the increase of business and factory closings and job losses. Yin noted that in the past two months, some businesses, mainly smaller ones, have been forced to close or suspend production. Several hundred taxi drivers went on strike Wednesday in Chongqing, in southwestern China, after the government said it planned to put more cabs on the district's roads, thereby increasing competition, the Gansu Daily newspaper said . And about 2,000 people rioted Monday in the impoverished northwestern province of Gansu over plans to move Longnan's city government offices, which were damaged in the May 12 Sichuan earthquake, to a nearby county. Residents, fearing the change would reduce their property values and threaten their livelihoods, clashed with police and looted government offices, the Gansu Daily reported. China's manufacturing sector, which produced 14 percent of the clothing, toys and footwear imported into the United States last year, has decelerated rapidly over the past few months, pulled down by a pair of factors. First, the global economic slowdown and the subsequent drop in consumer spending stymied demand for discretionary goods made in China. Second, Chinese manufacturers are battling rising labor and material costs at the same time that the yuan's rising value versus the dollar is making Chinese exports to the United States and elsewhere more expensive. Because of these challenges, more than 65,000 Chinese factories have gone bankrupt this year, said Lan Hailin, professor of business strategy with the South China University of Technology in Guangzhou, China. And as overseas orders continue to shrink, he thinks the number of bankruptcies will keep rising. The urban unemployment rate through October this year was 4 percent, lower than the government's projection of 4.5 percent. But Yin said Thursday the jobless numbers do not include migrant rural workers -- probably the most-affected group -- because they move so frequently. There are about 150 million migrant laborers in China, mostly in cities. Xinhua said Yin has predicted unemployment will rise in the first quarter of 2009. After that, he said, the stimulus package and other steps China has taken to boost the financial sector should boost employment, according to Xinhua. China hopes the growth of jobs will then cool down the protests. Until then, China is bracing for more demonstrations. Meng Jianzhu, minister of public security, was quoted by the BBC as warning police this week to be \"fully aware of the challenges brought by the global financial crisis.\" He said officers should be careful about how they handle \"mass incidents.\"",

Falling sick at sea can be an expensive nightmare for cruise passengers who may find themselves facing expensive medical bills, a new report warns today. Passengers who need to see a doctor on board their cruise ship complain of being hit by charges they feel are excessive, according to the investigation by Which? Travel. The report says that to many holidaymakers used to getting free NHS health care at home, the medical costs on board cruise ships come as a painful shock because they are all charged at private healthcare rates. Passengers on cruise ships feel they are being ripped off by cruise companies' on-board medical services . A survey by Which? found that one in five of the 1,368 members who had been on a cruise reported that they had visited the ship\u2019s doctors. They faced an average bill of \u00a3233 -- but 12 of the claims were for \u00a3500 or more and one reported a charge of \u00a36,500. Three in ten of those who saw a doctor had to foot the entire bill themselves as they could not claim any of the cost back on their insurance. one passenger who forgot to take enough blood pressure pills with her on a P&O cruise found that her forgetfulness cost her \u00a3154.. File picture . Nearly one in five said they could claim part of the cost back and had to pay the excess while four in ten said they could claim all the cost back but had to pay the excess. The majority of these charges were for one-off visits as six in ten people saw the doctor only once. Which? Travel says that one passenger who forgot to take enough blood pressure pills with her on a P&O cruise found that her forgetfulness cost her \u00a3154. Another passenger was presented with a bill for \u00a32,500 after being admitted to the ship\u2019s medical centre with pneumonia. Although her insurance policy covered \u00a32,000 she had to make up the \u00a3500 difference. 'These are not isolated cases \u201c said Which? Travel. 'Our members reported huge variations in how much they had to pay on cruise lines.' Angela Smith, commercial manager for Healix Risk Rating, which advises insurers on medical risks says that these charges can come as a shock to holidaymakers used to receiving free health care in the UK. She told the magazine: 'If someone is required to pay \u00a370 on board a ship to see a doctor, this won\u2019t break the bank. 'However, a hefty medical claim that requires hospital treatment will. Very few people can afford \u00a310,000 or \u00a3100,000 to pay these expenses. ' Which?

Lord Ken Maginnis, 75, a former Ulster Unionist Party MP, was found guilty at Dungannon Magistrates\u2019 Court of grabbing Keith Kirk by the arm and threatening to punch him. The court heard the peer became enraged after Mr Kirk honked his car horn at him during the incident in Dungannon last summer. Lord Ken Maginnis was convicted of assaulting driver Keith Kirk during a road rage incident last year . The peer admitted calling Mr Kirk a 'yellow bellied b******' but had denied the charge of common assault. District Judge John Meehan said he was satisfied the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. He fined Lord Maginnis \u00a3200 and ordered him to pay a further \u00a3200 in compensation to Mr Kirk. Following the hearing, the peer said he had already lodged an appeal. He said: 'I am obviously not letting it rest here. 'One . might say what\u2019s a couple of hundred pounds but this is my reputation. And I am appealing it, I can assure you I am appealing it.' He had previously suggested to the court that political factors were behind his prosecution. He told the court from the witness box that a speech he had delivered in the House of Lords earlier this year, in which he referred to the incident as a non-offence, had influenced the move to prosecute him. Lord Maginnis also claimed his threat to take court proceedings against Stephen Farry, Stormont's Employment and Learning Minister, was also a factor. Lord Maginnis (right) called Keith Kirk (left) a 'yellow bellied b******' and threatened to punch him . Mr Kirk told the court that he was taking his younger sister to the bank when a red Honda CRV pulled out of a junction in front of him without looking, causing him to break suddenly. He said he honked his horn - an act he alleged prompted Lord Maginnis to get out of his vehicle and march back to confront him through the wound down window. Mr Kirk claimed the peer, a former major in the Ulster Defence Regiment, grabbed his arm and held the other fist in the air threatening a punch. 'He grabbed my right arm with his left hand and he had his right hand in a fist, he was trying to hit me with it,' he claimed. The prosecution conceded it was a non injury assault and that the politician had not struck Mr Kirk. Judge Meehan said he had taken account of Lord Maginnis\u2019s years of public service in determining the punishment.",

Authorities became aware of suspect Jim Bailey last month after he tried to break up a dispute between a couple in a car by identifying himself as a retired cop and telling a witness to call 911, Oak Harbor Police Chief Edgar Green said. Liar: Authorities became aware of suspect Jim Bailey last month after he tried to break up a dispute between a couple in a car by identifying himself as a retired cop and telling a witness to call 911 . An investigation determined the 69-year-old Bailey had been pretending to be a retired officer for more than 20 years, the chief said. Impersonating a police officer is a gross misdemeanor in Washington. 'We're very proud of what we do and work very hard at what we do,' Green said. 'So to find someone who comes along and just takes that for granted and pretends to be one of us, that's upsetting.' Green said Bailey gave himself away when he saw a couple fighting in their car at an intersection and stopped to help, telling them he was a 'retired cop.' He was also wearing a shirt that identified him as an Oak Harbor officer when he was arrested. Even longtime family friend Joan Waldron said she thought Bailey had been an officer. 'That's shocking to me because I thought he was somehow related to the police department,' she said of the arrest. 'He really seems to be from all accounts an outstanding citizen,' she added. At least two other neighbors said they thought Bailey had been connected to law enforcement. Bailey's attorney counters that Bailey never claimed to be a police officer, retired or otherwise. Bailey's attorney says the situation is a misunderstanding and Bailey, who was arrested last week, is a good Samaritan who tried to help, KOMO reported Tuesday. A message left Friday by The Associated Press for attorney Christon Skinner wasn't immediately returned. Bailey has refused to respond to interview requests. Bailey spent a few years as an Oak Harbor reserve officer in the late 1980s but did not graduate from the police academy or become an officer. Green believes the deception may have been going on since 1991. He may have even collected paychecks for providing training and lectures under the guise of being a former officer.

This picture, released by the Sri Lankan defense ministry, is said to be of a dead Tamil Tiger body captured after fighting on May 14, 2009. The rebels -- formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- have fought for an independent state in Sri Lanka since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began. President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the end of the current military push, which is often referred to as a civilian rescue mission, is less than 48 hours away. He spoke from Jordan on Friday, where he's attending an economic summit. \"The Tamil civilians held hostage by the LTTE in small area of land in the north would be rescued, and the Tamils would be saved from the threat of LTTE terrorism,\" Rajapaksa said. In a rapid military push, Sri Lankan forces have squeezed Tamil Tiger fighters into approximately 1.5 square miles (four square kilometers) of coastal land. The United Nations estimates that more than 50,000 civilians are trapped there.  CNN's Paula Newton reports on the plight of trapped civilians \u00bb . The chunk of land, known as the no-fire zone or civilian safety area, was under siege by government forces Friday, according to Tamilnet.com, a rebel Web site. \"The entire safety zone area is in smoke ... as shelling by the Sri Lanka army was destroying all the structures within a narrow strip of coastal land, which is densely populated with tens of thousands of people,\" Tamilnet said. Humanitarian aid groups have reported mass civilian casualties in the fighting. \"The government is moving forward in extremely difficult circumstances. After all, the ... Tamil Tigers are seeded amidst the middle of all these civilians. It's very difficult to weed out and identify who is a fighter and who is not,\" said Gordon Weiss, a U.N. spokesman. \"It makes it very very dangerous for civilians, and it explains the very large toll on civilian life that we've seen at this point.\" Weiss called the fighting a \"bloodbath\" at the beginning of the week. The situation had worsened by Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. It suspended evacuation and medical rescue operations in the no-fire zone. Aid agencies had been stuck offshore, unable to deliver badly needed relief supplies and evacuate civilians. \"Our staff are witnessing an unimaginable humanitarian catastrophe,\" said Pierre Krahenbuhl, the Red Cross' director of operations. \"No humanitarian organization can help them in the current circumstances. People are left to their own devices.\" The U.N. Security Council and U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday called for both sides to protect civilians and allow humanitarian aid into the conflict zone.  Watch frustration build at the United Nations \u00bb . In a statement at the White House, Obama urged Sri Lankan government troops to halt the \"indiscriminate\" shelling of civilians trapped with the remnants of the country's Tamil Tigers. He also prodded the rebels to stop using civilians as human shields. Security Council members issued a statement demanding \"that all parties respect their obligations under international humanitarian law.\" A Red Cross worker was killed Wednesday during shelling in the conflict zone in Sri Lanka -- the third aid worker killed in six weeks -- the Red Cross said.",

When Tim Sherwood met Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy last week, he gave him three specific transfer targets. West Ham defender Winston Reid, Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry and Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku were the men he wanted at White Hart Lane next season. Sherwood\u2019s recommendations had been taken so seriously during a transfer meeting the previous month that director of football Franco Baldini went to watch Fulham play Everton on March 30, instead of travelling to Anfield to watch Tottenham. Given the 4-0 scoreline at Liverpool, it was a wise decision. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Sherwood defiant over Spurs future after 5-1 win . All over bar the shouting: Tim Sherwood will be replaced as Tottenham manager in the summer . Character: Sherwood has been outspoken as Spurs boss and at times it might have been too much . Attention! Sherwood (right) salutes Emmanuel Adebayor after the Spurs striker's second against Sunderland . Don't get too comfortable: Sherwood (centre) sits in the dug-out before Tottenham's 5-1 win over Sunderland . This break from the norm for Baldini, who usually sits close to Levy in the directors' box at Tottenham matches, was significant. Lukaku and Barry both played the full 90 minutes for Everton in their 3-1 victory and they were wanted men. Sherwood was desperate to get them to Spurs. At the time he was in with a chance of keeping the job, despite the interest from Louis van Gaal, Frank de Boer, Carlo Ancelotti and Mauricio Pochettino. Of the names under consideration at White Hart Lane, former Tottenham striker Jurgen Klinsmann is the only candidate who has not been agitating for the job behind the scenes. Big tick there from the boardroom. More on them in a moment. Sherwood knows he has made mistakes since he replaced Andre Villas-Boas as Tottenham\u2019s manager and it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask for the ear of the chairman after another leathering, this time at Anfield. Goodness knows Levy has had a gutful of that this season and anybody who knows him will tell you that no-one gets away with humiliating Tottenham\u2019s chairman in public. This season alone he has been on the end of some hidings: 6-0 and 5-1 against Manchester City, 5-0 and and 4-0 against Liverpool, 4-0 at Chelsea, 3-0 at home to West Ham and three defeats against Arsenal. In Levy\u2019s world, someone will always pay the price for that. Sherwood has certainly provided some entertainment in his 23 games in charge of Spurs, but Levy believes he lacks maturity and stature for such a prestigious position. Tim's targets: Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry (below left) and Winston Reid (below right) were wanted by Sherwood when he thought he still had a future as Tottenham manager . It probably wasn\u2019t wise, even in jest, for Sherwood to say that he would be returning to the technical area for the Sunderland game and \u2018might knock a few people out\u2019. He knows that. He is highly-emotional, passionate about his work and his team. There is something to be said for that, even if it is a bit much at times. Sherwood spoke of the \u2018shackles coming off\u2019 after the team ran out 5-1 winners against Sunderland on Monday, shining a torch on his pre-match team talk with Tottenham\u2019s players. They have been made aware that their manager is leaving at the end of the season and will be replaced someone with vast experience in the game. Waiting game: Louis van Gaal (right) has kept Spurs hanging on as he watches the situation at Manchester United . Big tick: Jurgen Klinsmann (left) is favoured by the Spurs board, while Frank De Boer also wants the job . Under pressure: Carlo Ancelotti (left) remains an option for Tottenham if he is fired by Real Madrid . Not the answer: Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino isn't ready to manage Tottenham . That is Levy\u2019s wish, something he has already articulated to his board as he begins to plan for next season. Presumably this means Southampton manager Pochettino, who has lost twice against Tottenham in the league this season, is not ready for the 14th biggest job in European football, according to the 2014 Deloitte Money League. At 42, a man who refuses to speak English despite a near perfect command of the language, is not the answer for Tottenham at this moment in time. Klinsmann, who is preparing for the World Cup with the USA, had been offered the position until the end of the season when Villas-Boas was fired. Levy had tried to tempt him with the bait that he could keep a closer eye on the Americans playing in Europe if he could help Spurs out in the short term. Klinsmann said no. Rebuilding job: Daniel Levy (front) will have to appoint yet another manager . After Real Madrid\u2019s stunning 4-3 defeat at home by Barcelona on March 23, Ancelotti was under so much pressure at the Bernabeu he believed he could be fired at the end of the season. His team are now third in La Liga, three points off Atletico, although they are in Friday\u2019s draw for the Champions League semi-final after beating Borussia Dortmund. Ancelotti has not been ruled out. The Italian remains an option if he is fired. Then there is Van Gaal, the man who has kept Tottenham waiting after hanging out for the possibility that Manchester United could replace David Moyes. The relative upturn in recent results, with the exception of the 3-0 defeat at home by Manchester City, has closed the door on Van Gaal\u2019s hopes of heading to Old Trafford. Moyes is staying for the time being. Sherwood will not remain and he will walk away from Spurs after their final game of the season at home to Aston Villa on May 11. Beyond that, Levy will have to start rebuilding this club. Again.",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\n(CNN) -- Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman Loera, a 54-year-old drug cartel leader whose nickname means \"Shorty,\" is the most wanted man in Mexico. He's also one of the most wanted men in the United States. Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel, which is battling for turf along the border. For five years, the State Department has kept a $5 million bounty on his head, calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security. Guzman, who leads the Sinaloa cartel, is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border. He recently upped the stakes, ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors, according to the Los Angeles Times. The cartel's tentacles and those of its chief rival, the Gulf cartel, already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; St. Louis, Missouri; and Charlotte, North Carolina, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March. \"No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does,\" said Arabit, who heads the DEA's office in this year's border hot spot, El Paso, Texas. See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S. A December 2008 report by the Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities. So far, the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico, where the cartels' running gunbattles with police, the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year. It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007. Once again, drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year, Arabit said.  See who the key players are \u00bb . The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker-on-trafficker, DEA agents say. But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire. \"It's coming. I guarantee, it's coming,\" said Michael Sanders, a DEA spokesman in Washington. Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman's shoot-to-kill instructions aren't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing sources and intelligence memos. The move is seen as dangerously brazen, the newspaper reported. In the past, the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement. U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border. The Obama administration committed to spending an additional $700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border. But $700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target. Guzman, who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel, is said to be worth $1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade. He made this year's Forbes list of the richest of the rich, landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell's Soup fortune. Popular Mexican songs, called narcocorridos, embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader. \"Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico,\" said security consultant Scott Stewart, invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993. Stewart, a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor, a Texas-based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman's worth. Just a decade ago, Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians, moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean. But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels. The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back. Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits. Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States, according to the DEA. Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine. Marijuana became the cartels' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007, bringing in $8.5 billion. Cocaine came in second, at $3.9 billion, and methamphetamine earned $1 billion, a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year.  Watch how marijuana became the cartels' top cash crop \u00bb . The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels, but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border, according to the DEA agents, local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN. The cartels' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa, Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence. The status and alliances of the players continue to shift. Although the DEA and some analysts disagree, others say the Zetas, a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police, are now running the Gulf cartel. \"From what we've seen, the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel,\" analyst Stewart said. \"In violent times, soldiers tend to rise to the top.\" These soldiers are incredibly well-armed, police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime \"Hummer\" Gonzalez Duran. It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles, including AK-47s; 287 grenades; two rocket launchers; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition. At the very least, the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table. The DEA's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate. Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, a former military man who is also known as \"El Lazco,\" or \"The Executioner.\" The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border's lucrative drug-trafficking corridors. The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas; Sonora Nogales, across from Nogales, Arizona; and Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, California. Two years ago, the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas. It's all about the highways that help move the drugs. Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor, and Juarez has easy access to I-10, a major east-west interstate, and I-25, which runs north to Denver, Colorado. Tijuana is also conveniently near I-10 and I-5, which heads north all the way to the Canadian border. Some of the battles are internal, Arabit said. Some are with other cartels. And some, he said, can be attributed to the cartels' \"desperate\" attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers. As soon as he took office in January 2007, Calderon called out the cartels. He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and, in some cases, do the job of local police. Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office. The violence involves beheadings, running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches. Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight. The cartels' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets. \"The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq,\" analyst Stewart said. \"It was simple machismo. The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas.\" When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s, the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant, beneficiaries of their location. Today, they are shadows of their former selves, weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders. Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997. Known as \"The King of the Skies\" for his fleet of cocaine-carrying planes, he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance-altering procedures to avoid arrest. Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery. Two of them later were killed. His death, along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen, set the stage for the ongoing turf battle. When Cardenas was extradited in 2007, Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez  as well as Nogales. Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston, Texas, where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros, Mexico. Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano-Felix Organization in Tijuana, and last year, Guzman made a move on that plaza as well. \"Right now, they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar,\" said the DEA's Elizabeth Kempshall, who heads the agency's office in Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix has become the nation's kidnapping capital, largely because of the cartels' increasing presence. Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition: \"That is the worst thing for any cartel leader, to face justice in the United States.\" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this story .",

Ally McCoist insists Sir David Murray is owed an apology from people both \u2018in and out of football\u2019 after the \u2018needless\u2019 collapse of Rangers in 2012. Last week Murray pointed the finger at the taxman after a judge kicked out HMRC\u2019 s appeal in their long-running case against the Ibrox club. The former owner and chairman said the so-called Big Tax Case case had put off potential buyers and led to Craig Whyte\u2019s disastrous takeover, while fans groups have already called for the SFA, SPFL and other club owners to be held to account over the decision to relegate Rangers when they went bust. Leader: Rangers boss Ally McCoist with players Lee McCulloch (left) and Richard Foster . Still got it: McCoist kicks a ball around during training in California . On Tuesday McCoist said he would \u2018never forget\u2019 the role played by leading figures in and around the Scottish game in his club\u2019s descent into financial meltdown. As he called for answers from those he believes are truly responsible for his club\u2019s demise, however, the Rangers boss conceded he won\u2019t be holding his breath for any inquiry or apologies from those involved in the saga. Speaking from his club\u2019s pre-season training base in California, McCoist said: \u2018Do people have serious questions to answer? One hundred per cent. I don\u2019t know if I would use the word witch-hunt. But I would definitely say there are certain people that I would hope David Murray would get some answers from in high-up places \u2013 both in and out of the game. \u2018But I\u2019ll tell you right now - I don\u2019t think we would get an enquiry. And I would be very, very doubtful if David Murray would get an apology from certain people either. \u2018But it leaves, at best, a very, very bad taste in my mouth and in the mouths of a lot of people at Rangers when you think of what has happened to this club. \u2018It needn\u2019t have happened and it\u2019s horrendous \u2013 and I will never forget some of the things which have been said and done to our club by people who should have known better.\u2019 Owed: McCoist believes that former Ranger's chief Sir David Murray deserves an apology . Meltdown: Craig Whyte, who took over from Murray, led the club to the point of ruin . An under-pressure Murray sold Rangers to Craig Whyte for a token \u00a31 in May 2011 at a time when the club was in dispute with HMRC over an Employee Benefit Trust scheme set up a decade before. Rangers subsequently plummeted into administration in February 2012 after the Whyte regime failed to pay tax totalling \u00a314million. HMRC rejected proposals that could have prevented the Ibrox oldco from being liquidated and ultimately demoted to League Two, but the tax man went on to lose the original First Tier Tribunal on the EBT case by a majority verdict in November 2013. HMRC lost an appeal against that verdict last week.",

'Good experience': Thief Alister Lamb (pictured) faces jail after missing his community service appointments because he was taking part in the Jeremy Kyle show . A thief is facing jail after he went on the Jeremy Kyle Show instead of doing his community service. Alister Lamb was convicted last year of stealing a string of items including a toilet seat from a flat in Dundee. On November 11 last year, Sheriff Tom Hughes imposed 200 hours of unpaid work in the community as part of a community payback order instead of sending Lamb to jail. But Lamb - who has previous convictions for cannabis possession and assault to injury - completed only one hour of work between that date and April 10 this year. And when asked by social workers why he hadn\u2019t done the work he told them he had missed appointments because he had been filming an episode of the Jeremy Kyle Show. He had gone on the show in a bid to get access to his daughter from a previous relationship. Despite now facing a period in custody, Lamb said: \u2018It was a good experience.\u2019 Lamb, 23, of Baldovie Terrace, Dundee, previously admitted a charge of theft by housebreaking. He and another man broke into a flat occupied by William Wallace in Whitfield Avenue, Dundee, between February 11 and 12 last year. They stole a television, an xBox console and accessories, ornaments and a train set. Bizarrely, the pair also stole a toilet seat in the raid. In a report submitted to Dundee Sheriff Court outlining the breach of his order, social workers said: \u2018It would appear that Mr Lamb has not afforded his orders due priority which is evidenced by his continued failures to attend. \u2018His most recent evidence to cover absences was an appearance on TV, namely the Jeremy Kyle Show. \u2018He reports that he now has access to his children which he contributes to his recent appearance on the Jeremy Kyle Show. \u2018There has been no other substantial changes in his circumstances that should preclude him from attending. 'Mr Lamb again has not afforded his order due priority. \u2018This despite having been granted extensive periods of time in which to submit evidence. 'No commitment to order': Lamb said he was a 'really nervous' during the filming of the Jeremy Kyle Show. The episode he appears in has not yet aired . \u2018Even when evidence has been submitted and accepted\u2019 I have no option but to call in to question his commitment to his order given the most recent evidence used was an appearance on the Jeremy Kyle Show. \u2018I therefore have no alternative but to request that court consider revoking said order in view to imposing an alternative disposal.\u2019 Lamb would have faced a jail sentence when he appeared in court for sentence today, but he failed to attend court at 9.30am. Sheriff Tom Hughes granted a warrant for his arrest. Lamb then turned up at court at 10.40am, but was told his case could not be recalled. Outside court, Lamb said he had been transported to and from the filming of the show by taxi and had been put up in a hotel by producers. He said: \u2018I wasn\u2019t that good, I was really nervous. It was a good experience though. \u2018I watch the Jeremy Kyle show on the telly, so I thought I\u2019d phone them. \u2018I was trying to get access through the lawyers, but I thought I\u2019d try this instead.\u2019 A spokeswoman for the Jeremy Kyle Show said the episode Lamb was involved in has not yet been aired.",

Joshua Durcho told a friend he choked Summer Rust but said her children were elsewhere, an affidavit says. Joshua Steven Durcho is charged with five counts of first degree murder in the January deaths of Summer Rust, 25; her son Teagin, 4; and daughters Evynn, 3, and Autumn and Kirsten, both 7. All five bodies were found January 12 in Rust's apartment in El Reno, Oklahoma, about 30 miles west of Oklahoma City. Authorities believe Durcho killed Rust because she threatened to call the police on him, prosecutors said in court documents released Tuesday. He knew that likely would bring about his arrest, the documents said, because two outstanding bench warrants had been issued on him after he failed to appear in court in two criminal cases -- one on charges of driving under the influence and the second on charges of unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance. Durcho had previously served time in prison after being convicted of unlawful possession of marijuana and \"vowed he would never go back to prison,\" the court documents said. Prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty against Durcho, according to the documents, which note each victim suffered \"severe pain and anguish\" as they fought for their lives while being strangled with a ligature, which could include a string, cord or wire. In addition, the documents said, evidence indicates Durcho sexually abused both the 7-year-old girls at or near the time they died. In Tuesday's arraignment, Canadian County District Judge Edward Cunningham entered not guilty pleas on Durcho's behalf, according to The Oklahoman newspaper. An affidavit filed in the case, written by an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agent, said Durcho went to the home of an acquaintance January 12 and said he had \"choked\" Summer Rust -- identified in court papers as Summer Garas -- to death and was leaving Oklahoma. When the acquaintance, a women, asked Durcho about Rust's children, he \"told her that the children were at their grandmother's residence ... while he and Summer worked out their relationship problems,\" according to the affidavit. The acquaintance then called Durcho's mother, who drove to the apartment but received no answer at the door, the affidavit said. She asked her nephew, Durcho's cousin, to accompany her, leading to the discovery of Rust's body. The cousin notified police, and responding officers found the children's bodies in the apartment. According to the court documents released Tuesday, Durcho also told the female acquaintance that he killed Rust because she threatened to call the police on him. Durcho was arrested in Hamilton County, Texas, the day after the bodies were found.

Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a new bill into law Sunday that will fine paparazzi for taking photos that invade a celebrity's right to privacy. The law also targets media outlets who purchase the photos. Singer Britney Spears' run-ins with paparazzi took center stage a few years ago when she took an umbrella to a photographer's SUV. Throngs of photographers often jockey to get the perfect shot of a celebrity, but that doesn't mean it's welcomed. Britney Spears famously had enough one night, taking an umbrella to a photographer's SUV. In 1998, Schwarzenegger himself had his car swarmed by paparazzi while he was picking up his child from school. Jennifer Aniston received $550,000 and an apology from a photographer who used a high-powered telephoto lens to shoot her in the backyard wearing only panties.  Watch how stars impact paparazzi \u00bb . While paparazzi may get a bad rap for their methods, celebrity columnist Ben Widdicombe said things are not always what they seem. \"A lot of times the shot you see in the magazine is actually orchestrated by the celebrity themselves,\" said celebrity columnist Ben Widdicombe. \"Celebrities like Britney Spears, for example, are infamous in the industry for letting their assistants tell the paparazzi when they'll be leaving the gates.\" Celebrity photos can be big business, especially when it comes to major milestones. Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher reportedly pocketed $3 million from OK for their 2005 union. Eva Longoria and Tony Parker received $2 million from OK for photos of their lavish Paris, France, wedding. Expectant celebrities can also rake in big bucks. People magazine reportedly paid $14 million for the first pictures of the Brad Pitt-Angelina Jolie twins. The new California law makes it a crime to take and sell unauthorized photos of celebrities in \"personal or familial activity.\" Violators face fines up to $50,000.

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\nAccra, Ghana (CNN) -- They're cramped, loud and seem to care little about the rules of the road -- more than just a mode of transportation, riding a \"tro-tro\" is an experience of its own, a roller coaster ride that any self-respecting visitor to Accra should check off their list. The crammed, hot and often rickety minivans, also called \"troskies,\" are the most popular way of getting around in the Ghanaian capital. They can be picked up from a station or by the roadside and they typically seat around 15 squished passengers, sometimes even more, as they swerve, zigzag and rush through Accra's busy streets. Read this: Forget Paris, fall in love with Accra . But while tro-tro rides might not be the ideal travel option for the claustrophobic, they're certainly more appealing to anyone looking to navigate the city cheaply. Just like \"matatus\" in East Africa, and many other similar means of transport in urban centers across the continent, tro-tros fill the public demand for affordable trips -- the fee a tro-tro ride around Accra is never more than a few cents, paid before or on arrival. \"If you really want to get to know a city, don't take a taxi -- take a tro-tro,\" says Accra commuter Maximillian Effah. So how does the tro-tro system work and what can you expect once you catch a ride? Tro-tros might have set routes but in the absence of a fixed schedule -- the vans depart only once they're full -- waiting times can be lengthy. Boarding the right one can also be confusing, especially if you're picking it up from the roadside. Read this: Artists take epic Africa road trip . In those cases, what's needed is a mixture of cunning and alertness, coupled with determination and some insider knowledge. As the tro-tro approaches, the fare collector, or \"mate,\" hangs out the right side door, shouting the destination and making a sign to indicate the van's direction. You do the same and, with a little a bit of luck, the driver stops so you can hop on. Sometimes, however, securing a spot requires a more physical approach. \"When you have a situation with 10, 15, up to 20 people trying to enter the same door at the same time, that's when you see the magic happening,\" says Effah. \"People opening up the top of the car, sliding in the side screen and then jumping into the car. Then you'll see the car start to move with someone halfway in the car, with their legs dangling outside of the car, and that is just crazy!\" Once en route, forget about seat belts or spacious seating; you can expect, however, a bumpy ride that's often made easier by the inevitable mix of shared laughs, heated debates and social commentary -- as well as a bit of singing. \"The driver of the tro-tro was singing the entire time, it could actually be that his part-time job was in the choir because he was singing a lot of hymns,\" recalls Accra commuter Francis Kweku Ansah of one memorable journey. \"He was really entertaining for everyone in the car -- people started singing along and it was actually a really fun journey for me.\" \"Trotro Diaries\" At least four million people live in and around Accra, making it one of Africa's largest cities. Its infrastructure is like many other African urban centers: aged from the colonial era and unable to keep up with the demands of a burgeoning population. As more Ghanaians jump behind the wheel -- thanks to a growing middle class and cheaper imports from overseas -- the city's streets are often clogged with snail-paced traffic. Read this: Africa's new skyscraper cities . \"You have an experience where you sit in a tro-tro tightly packed and it's just before work so you can imagine the kind of pressure it puts on you,\" says Yaw Odoom, the creator of Trotro Diaries, an online platform where people share their often-funny stories about their daily transport woes. \"We realized people go through so much stress to get to their offices, which might affect their output,\" says Odoom. \"We put a bit of humor in there, where people in different tro-tros all over Ghana and even in other parts of the world share their experience. Now what this will do is it will help to lighten their mood, so when they get to the office they actually get there in a happier mood and be able to deliver.\" Encouraged by friends, Odoom, a 27-year-old business development manager at an automotive company, created a blog and a Facebook group and today more than 1,000 people use the Trotro Diaries platform to sound off. \"Aah, I really hate it when people are in singing in (the) troskie,\" reads one comment. \"I'm like, this is not your car, dude!\" \"She has been talking for about 30 minutes non-stop!\" says another Trotro Diaries user. \"I guess the radio stations need her talent!\" Odoom says he now plans to also create a Trotro Diaries app that will also serve to help commuters find their way easier around the city. He believes that creating information networks for Ghanaians on-the-go, as well as making them laugh with each other, can have a positive impact. \"(The future of Ghana is) in the hands of the youth and we're already taking it,\" he says. \"We are crazy for change and we want to put that change into Ghana because Ghana is for all of us and we need to make things work.\" Have you been on a tro-tro, or a taken a mini-van ride elsewhere in Africa?

Gold Coast toddler, 22-month-old Ryven, was born with the extremely rare genetic condition Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), which deteriorates his quality of life and could be fatal. The average life expectancy of a male with WAS is 15 to 20 years. Scroll down for video . An excited Ryven announces the news of the new sibling that will come into the world in March 2015 - who will not only add to their family but answer his family's prayers. The new baby boy will be the genetic donor match Ryven desperately needs . Cindy and Rob Harris are excited to welcome their second child, a son, in March 2015, who will be the genetic match for their son Ryven. Their new son will hopefully save Ryven's life . Ryven was born with\u00a0the extremely rare genetic condition Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome and diagnosed at 12 weeks. His parents feared he would never leave the hospital . Ryven, who will turn two on December 28, has not had an easy start to life but is a happy boy with a beautiful smile, who with the love and support of his parents will hopefully be able to go to school and lead a positive and normal life . Ryven is quite literally one in a million, with only one to ten cases of WAS per million males worldwide. His only hope for a cure is a bone marrow transplant, except the toddler has a very rare blood type and can not find a match, despite being on a registry of 15 million people. When Cindy and Rob couldn\u2019t find a solution, they turned to IVF and the wonders of modern medicine to make the perfect match their son needs to stay alive. They decided to have a baby to save their son. It was difficult, expensive and \u2018an emotional rollercoaster\u2019 but the Harris family knew they would do anything to help their little boy. Ryven's parents campaigned for blood donation, when their son urgently needed a platelet transfusion but the Australian Red Cross blood bank were nearly completely out of Ryven's blood type . In 24 hours, more than 5000 people responsed to the call for action - to join 'Team Ryven' After four rounds of IVF, the couple are thrilled to be expecting another little boy who will have a special and unique bond with his brother, knowing that they were picked for each other. \u2018It\u2019s a gamble, we know that and it\u2019s one we\u2019re willing to take because we\u2019ll get to save our little boy and we get another beautiful baby,\u2019 Ms Harris told The Today Show. \u2018We\u2019re fortunate because we get to put Ryven through a transplant with a 12 out of 12 perfect match, which is extremely hard to find.\u2019 When the baby is born, the cord blood will be saved for Ryven. Ryven needs to be very careful, but by all accounts is a joyful little boy with a love of life.\u00a0Ryven\u2019s body struggles to make platelets, which means his blood is not able to clot properly.Even the slightest bump can cause serious bruising and hematomas . Later, when Ryven needs a bone marrow transplant, he will have \u2018a 12 out of 12 match\u2019, which is the best possible outcome. To conceive a baby with the same blood type as Ryven, doctors needed to find an embryo with an identical tissue match. \u2018The scientists are amazing because the gene that I carry is not going to be passed onto the new baby,\u2019 Ms Harris told The Today Show. \u2018He\u2019s going to be a healthy boy with, touchwood, no complications.\u2019 Ryven\u2019s body struggles to make platelets, which means his blood is not able to clot properly. Even the slightest bump can cause serious bruising and hematomas. With Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), Ryven is at risk of excessive bleeding or haemorrhaging. Ryven also has a weak immune system, which prevents him from being as social as most children. \u2018At the moment he\u2019s very isolated and he can\u2019t go to day care,\u2019 said Mr Harris. \u2018Our dream is for him to go to school one day and have some friends.\u2019 Although he is a vibrant little boy, Ryven was given an incredibly difficult start to life, with his parents unsure if he would ever leave the hospital. Ryven also has a weak immune system, which prevents him from being as social as most children . His struggles with WAS were made even more life-threatening by his incredibly rare blood type. A year ago, Ryven was fighting for his life in hospital when the Australian Red Cross blood bank almost ran out of his specific blood type, O-negative CMB-negative. His parents made a plea on The Today Show for the public to donate blood, platelets and join the bone marrow registry \u2013 particularly those with the same blood type as Ryven. Within 24 hours, the Red Cross had received more than 5000 calls and 2000 online enquiries about donation. It was the busiest day in the call centre since the Black Saturday fires. Thanks to the campaign for Ryven, for the first time ever, O negative blood supplies are at an adequate level. Ryven also has a weak immune system, which prevents him from being as social as most children . Thanks to the Ryven's campaign, for the first time ever, O negative blood supplies are at an adequate level . The couple, with the help of friends and family, have started the Ryven Foundation to support Wiskott-Aldrich Patients . They are campaigning to raise awareness and funds, so people understand how the choice to donate blood can be the difference between life and death. \u2018To donate blood marrow isn\u2019t actually scarry. It\u2019s a couple of injections, a blood transfusion through a tube and that\u2019s it,\u2019 Ms Harris told The Today Show. \u2018If we can get the message out there that that\u2019s what it is and that will save a life, I think a lot more people will get on the registry.\u2019 They are thrilled about the imminent arrival of their second child, who will have a unique and special bond with his brother Ryven \u2013 after all, they were picked especially for each other.

But 50 years ago, they were the young faces of the civil rights movement, who headed to the nation's capital -- even if it meant hitchhiking -- to be a part of history. These men and women joined nearly a quarter of a million others from across the country to take part in the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. Some even had chance encounters with civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The most famous moment of the march was King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, which he delivered from a podium at the Lincoln Memorial to a crowd of an estimated 210,000 people. Photographer captures faces of the march . Many thought the event would descend into violence, but it did not. There were 5,000 police officers, National Guardsmen and Army Reservists present, but no marchers were arrested, and no incidents concerning marchers were reported. The march was the culmination of the civil rights movement, and it is credited for helping spur lawmakers to pass the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965. There were civil rights leaders, Hollywood celebrities and thousands of ordinary people who knew it was time for the United States to give the same rights to everyone, regardless of race. CNN caught up with a few of those marchers today. Bernice King's difficult journey . Patricia Worthy . Patricia Worthy was a college student just looking for a summer job when she got hired as the receptionist at the March on Washington planning office. \"I don't think I had a title,\" Worthy recalled. \"I answered the phones.\" She had 10 phone lines to answer, and they rang from the time she walked in until she left for the day. \"I recall one day I'll never forget, I heard someone say, 'Where is this young lady who handles the phone?' And finally I looked up, and there he was -- Dr. King -- and he said, 'I want to meet this young lady. She has put me on the hold twice, and hung up on me once, and I want to know who she is.' \" Worthy said she was \"so embarrassed,\" but then the civil rights icon gave her a hug. By the day of the march, she was so tired, she dozed off and accidentally slept through the historic march and the \"I Have a Dream\" speech. After a career practicing law -- including a case involving the government's wiretapping of King -- Worthy has been a law professor at Howard University since 2004. Lessons from successful movements . John Lewis . At 23 years old, John Lewis was the youngest speaker at the March on Washington and probably the most controversial. He had just been elected to lead the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Lewis' father was a sharecropper in rural Alabama, where he grew up and went to segregated schools. According to his biography, Lewis \"was inspired by the activism surrounding the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., which he heard on radio broadcasts.\" His prepared text for the March on Washington included a threat to march through the South like Gen. William Sherman during the Civil War unless there was progress on civil rights. That didn't sit well with his fellow civil rights leaders. \"On the night of August 27, 1963, I received a note under my door from (march organizer) Bayard Rustin saying, in effect, that there was some concern about my speech,\" Lewis said. \"My speech was pretty strong.\" Another march organizer, A. Philip Randolph, also asked Lewis to edit his speech. \"And Mr. Randolph came and said, 'John, we come this far together. Can you change this? Can you delete that? Let's stay together,' \" Lewis recalled. So he did. Today, Lewis, 73, is the only surviving speaker. He has represented Georgia in the U.S. Congress for 14 consecutive terms. Some days, he still walks down to the Lincoln Memorial to stand where they all once stood. MLK memorial ready for anniversary . Robert Avery . Robert Avery knew the dark side of the civil rights movement. A month after the student protests in Birmingham, Alabama, turned violent, Avery -- 15 years old at the time -- joined anti-segregation demonstrations in Gadsden, Alabama. Police responded with force, cracking down with batons and prods, and arresting more than 460. Avery still lives with burn scars from a cattle prod. Months later, Avery and two of his friends were determined to get to Washington for the March on Washington. They couldn't afford to make the trip via traditional means, so they decided to hitchhike the 700 miles between Gadsden and the nation's capital. They walked at least a dozen miles up a dark highway before they got their first ride. After three days of hitchhiking, they arrived in Washington a week before the march. The three youths were put to work making signs for the march at the local headquarters. That weekend, a civil rights leader walked in and asked for them. He had been in Gadsden the night before, and their parents wanted him to check on them. King sat down with the three and talked to them for perhaps 20 minutes, asking them about their dreams. Today, Avery continues to serve as a city councilman in Gadsden, a position he has held since 1986. The only class MLK taught . Harry Belafonte . Harry Belafonte, a popular actor and Grammy Award-winning singer in the 1960s, used his star power to help bring other celebrities to the March on Washington. \"For myself personally -- beyond raising money, beyond speaking at events that helped to raise money to bring citizens to the Mall -- my task, my larger task, was to organize a cultural contingency to come to the March on Washington,\" Belafonte reflected. Besides reaching out to the stars themselves, Belafonte went to many of the studio heads in Hollywood to get prominent actors and actresses temporarily released from their duties so they could participate. He was successful. The Hollywood list of attendees that day read like a who's who of A-listers: Marlon Brando, Sidney Poitier, Lena Horne, Sammy Davis Jr., Charlton Heston and Burt Lancaster, who also gave a speech. But having the Hollywood stars there wasn't just for show or for increased media attention. It also helped calm President John F. Kennedy's nerves about the march. \"I believe that their presence did a lot to assuage people who are preoccupied with the fact there could be violence,\" Belafonte said. \"One of the things that I said in my conversations with the Kennedys in discussing why they should be more yielding in their support of our demonstration was the fact that there would be such a presence of highly profiled artists -- that that alone would put anxiety to rest,\" he added. \"People would be looking at the occasion in a far more festive way.\" Belafonte continued his acting and singing career, and today, at 86, he is still an activist for human rights causes. At the March on Washington: The anger, fear, love and hope . Rachelle Horowitz . Rachelle Horowitz took a break from her job at the Worker's Defense League in 1963 to be in charge of March on Washington transportation -- despite the fact she couldn't even drive. \"And I was totally horrified and frightened about this notion,\" she said. \"And I said something that also in retrospect seems fairly silly. 'How can I be the transportation director? I can't drive,' which I couldn't. I was a New Yorker. And also I had lost my bus on every previous march.\" But with the encouragement of her mentor and future lifelong colleague, march organizer Bayard Rustin, Horowitz proceeded to organize all the buses, trains and planes for the more than 200,000 people who attended the march that day. In a time long before e-mail and Facebook, this was no easy task. Horowitz used a system of 5x3 index cards and massive lists attached to the office walls to keep track of all the various travel options. After her months of tedious work came to fruition with a well-attended and successful march, Horowitz reveled in the moment at the end of the day. \"All of us who had worked on the march,\" continued Horowitz, \"were just incredibly happy and pleased with what had happened. And we all linked hands and sang 'We Shall Overcome.' \" Horowitz went on to be Rustin's assistant and eventually served as the political director for the American Federation of Teachers.",

'Their ability to get there was delayed by about a week because their flight was canceled and they were stuck in a neighboring country,' Frieden told a press conference Saturday, according to The Hill. 'In terms of the entry process, we really need to be clear that we don't inadvertently increase the risk to people in this country by making it harder for us to respond to the needs in those countries, by making it harder to get assistance in and therefore those outbreaks would become worse, go on longer, and paradoxically, something that we did to try and protect ourselves might actually increase our risk.'

Anti-government protesters gather in front of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport early Wednesday. The newly married husband and wife, in Thailand for their  honeymoon, were struggling to find a way home to California after explosions at two Bangkok airports wounded four people and both  airports were shut down. The day before, thousands of anti-government protesters stormed the airports to protest the return of Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat from an economic summit in Peru. \"The upper level outside is really crowded with protesters and for the most part they're kind of quiet and polite,\" Gannon said from the airport.  \"They're roaming the airport, they're cheering and clapping and walking around, but it's clearly their domain.\"  Watch protesters clash \u00bb . It was not clear which of the two occupied airports she was speaking from, but tourists were stranded in both. The People's Alliance for Democracy , which is leading the protests, said it will not end its occupation of the airports until the prime minister resigns. They accuse his government of being a front for ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Ongoing protests caused authorities to cancel all incoming and outgoing flights at the main hub, Suvarnabhumi International Airport, which handles 60,000 incoming passengers daily, an assistant to airport director Serirat Prasutanond told CNN. Pro- and anti-government protesters also exchanged gunfire Tuesday, a Thai police official said. Protesters with golf clubs and long wooden sticks clashed with airport taxi drivers, with each side throwing objects at the other.  Watch what's causing the protests \u00bb .

We just sit here and relax and enjoy the ride.\" Gannon said she and her new spouse just hope to get home sometime in the near future. \"We've been gone for 17 days and [the honeymoon] was good -- until now,\" she said. \"We are just trying to go home, get back to work and Thanksgiving.\"",

I double-checked on the internet and there it was, the very same picture, in Maidstone, Kent.\u2019 He pointed out that it would be easier to visit the castle from Heathrow, near London, than from the city of Leeds. Off base: The airline has apologised for the 'silly mistake' and reassured customers pilots had 'no trouble' locating Leeds . The city of Leeds in Yorkshire is some 200 miles away (pictured). The blunder was pointed out by baffled customers . Mr Guildford, the director of a company that makes match programmes for Leeds United football club, added: \u2018It\u2019s one of those things that everyone worries about \u2013 that companies have a very London-based, South-based view of our country. \u2018So when our national carrier doesn\u2019t even know where Leeds Castle is, it makes you worry. I know that Leeds has a great deal to offer, but not that particular castle.\u2019 In fact, the castle\u2019s name has nothing to do with the city of Leeds, although it is linked to Leeds village, which is near Maidstone. The word leeds, in this case, derives from esledes \u2013 an old English word meaning slope or hillside. There has been a castle on the site since 1119. British Airways owned up to the error last night. A spokesman said: \u2018We\u2019re sorry for the silly mistake. Fortunately our pilots have no trouble at all recognising Leeds.\u2019",
        "output": "British Airways advertised a getaway to the city with image of Leeds Castle .\nThe landmark in Maidstone, Kent, is some 200 miles away from Yorkshire city .\nAirline  apologised and reassured 'pilots have no trouble' getting to Leeds ."

The bizarre six-sided storm churning Saturn\u2019s north pole has flummoxed astronomers ever since it was first spotted thirty years ago. Now, astronomers believe they may have solved one of its biggest mysteries by working out how it operates - and discovering the rotation period of Saturn in the process. The giant storm operates rather like the jet stream on Earth they say - explaining why it never appears to move. Scroll down for video and animations... The animation above shows a view from directly over Saturn's north pole, keeping up with the rotation of the planet so that all the motion seen on the screen is the motion of the storms inside the hexagon. The mysterious six-sided hexagon on Saturn\u2019s North Pole has long captivated astronomers is thought to be is nearly 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers). The hexagon is made of a band of . upper-atmospheric winds which creates its six-sided shape. A polar . cyclone can be seen at its centre. First seen by Voyagers 1 and 2 over 30 years ago the hexagon it thought to be fixed with Saturn\u2019s rotation. Last year, the Cassini spacecraft . provided scientists with the first close-up, visible-light views of a . behemoth hurricane swirling within the hexagon. Thin, . bright clouds at the outer edge of the hurricane were estimated to be . travelling at around 330 mph (150 metres per second). The unusual structure with a hexagonal shape surrounding Saturn's north pole was spotted on the planet for the first time thirty years ago. The hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200 mph winds and spans 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across - more than twice the diameter of Earth. Nothing similar with such a regular geometry had ever been seen on any planet in the Solar System. The Planetary Sciences Group has now been able to study and measure the phenomenon and, establish its rotation period, and that of Saturn - the only planet in the Solar System whose rotation time remains unknown. Researchers found seasonal variations do not affect the hexagon and its jet stream at all, so concluded both are part of an extensive wave, deeply rooted in Saturn's atmosphere. The UPV/EHU researchers suggest that the hexagon and its stream are the manifestation of a 'Rossby wave' similar to those that form in the mid-latitudes of the earth. On our planet the jet stream meanders from west to east and brings, associated with it, the system of areas of low pressure and anticyclones which we have been seeing regularly on weather maps. On Saturn, a hydrogen gas planet, ten times the size of the Earth, cold in its upper clouds, without a solid surface, and with an atmosphere as deep as that of an ocean, 'the hexagonal wavy motion of the jet stream is expected to be propagated vertically and reveal to us aspects of the planet\u2019s hidden atmosphere,' said Agust\u00edn S\u00e1nchez-Lavega, Head of the Planetary Sciences research group. Saturn's storm in action: Scientists have announced a breakthrough in understand how the storm is created . 'The movement of the hexagon could therefore be linked to the depths of Saturn, and the rotation period of this structure, which, as we have been able to ascertain, is 10 hours, 39 minutes and 23 seconds, could be that of the planet itself,' he added. Saturn is the only planet in the Solar System whose rotation period is not yet known. Due to the tilt of approximately 27\u00ba of the planet Saturn, its polar atmosphere undergoes intense seasonable variations with long polar nights lasting over seven years, followed by a long period of 23 years of variable illumination. In 1980 and 1981 NASA's Voyager 1 and 2 space probes passed for the first time over the planet Saturn, located 1,500 million km from the Sun. Among their numerous discoveries they observed a strange, hexagon-shaped structure in the planet\u2019s uppermost clouds surrounding its north pole. The new analysis allowed astronomers to track the hexagonal storm for the first time to see how it rotated, and work out how it was formed . The hexagon remained virtually static, and images captured by the Voyager probes found that the clouds were moving rapidly inside the hexagon in an enclosed jet stream and were being dragged by winds travelling at over 400 km/h. Thirty years later \u2013the equivalent of one Saturn year, in other words, the time the planet takes to go all the way around the Sun\u2013 and over more than six consecutive years, researchers in the UPV/EHU\u2019s Planetary Sciences Group, in collaboration with astronomers from various countries, were able to observe Saturn's northern polar region in detail once again and confirmed that the hexagon continued in place. After measuring the positions of the hexagon vertices with great precision, they determined that its movement remains extremely stable, and on the basis of the cloud movements, that the jet stream inside it remains unchanged. It comes just months after footage captured by the Cassini spacecraft using colour filters, showed researchers a complete view of the top of Saturn for the first time. \u2018A hurricane on Earth typically lasts a week, but this has been here for decades - and who knows - maybe centuries,\u2019 said Andrew Ingersoll, at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. This animation above shows a view from directly over the north pole, keeping up with the rotation of the planet so that all the motion seen on the screen is the motion of the storms inside the hexagon. This older, colour composite image - showing false shades - has been created from raw images taken by Cassini from a distance of 379,268 miles away . Weather patterns on Earth are interrupted when they encounter friction from land forms. Scientists suspect the stability of the . hexagon has something to do with the lack of solid land forms on Saturn, . which is essentially a giant ball of gas. Better views of the hexagon are available now because the sun began to illuminate its interior in late 2012. Cassini captured images of the hexagon over a 10-hour time span with high-resolution cameras, giving scientists a good look at the motion of cloud structures within. Scientists saw the storm around the pole, as well as small vortices rotating in the opposite direction of the hexagon. Some of the vortices are swept along with the jet stream as if on a racetrack. The largest of these vortices spans about 2,200 miles (3,500 km), or about twice the size of the largest hurricane recorded on Earth. The footage captured by the Cassini spacecraft is the first of its kind, using colour filters, to show a complete view of the top of Saturn . Scientists analysed these images in false colour, a rendering method that made it easier to distinguish differences among the types of particles suspended in the atmosphere inside and outside the hexagon. \u2018Inside the hexagon, there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles, while outside the hexagon, the opposite is true,\u2019 said Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University in Virginia. \u2018The hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier, which results in something like Earth's Antarctic ozone hole.\u2019 The Antarctic ozone hole forms within a region enclosed by a jet stream with similarities to the hexagon. Wintertime . conditions enable ozone-destroying chemical processes to occur and the . jet stream prevents a resupply of ozone from the outside. At Saturn, large aerosols cannot cross . into the hexagonal jet stream from outside and large aerosol particles . are created when sunlight shines on the atmosphere. Only . recently, with the start of Saturn's northern spring in August 2009, . did sunlight begin bathing the planet's northern hemisphere. \u2018As . we approach Saturn's summer solstice in 2017, lighting conditions over . its north pole will improve, and we are excited to track the changes . that occur both inside and outside the hexagon boundary,\u2019 said Scott . Edgington, Cassini deputy project scientist.",
        "output": "Storm on Saturn's north pole rages with winds of 200mph .\nLargest wind system is 2,200 miles wide - this is twice the size of largest hurricane ever recorded on planet Earth .\nDiscovery has also led astronomers to calculate how often Saturn rotates for the first time ."

One of Islamic State's top commanders in Kobane is also Kurdish, a man known as Abu Khattab al-Kurdi - which translates as Abu Khattab the Kurd. Hundreds of Kurds have joined forces with the Islamic State, but it is not known how many are fighting with the 3,000 ISIS troops in their seven-week battle for Kobane, a strategically key Syrian town on the Turkish border. Traitor: Hundreds of Kurdish troops are thought to be fighting with ISIS in Kobane against their own people, including Abu Khattab al-Kurdi (pictured) one of the militants' top commanders . Lethal: There are thought to be around 3,000 ISIS troops fighting in the seven-week battle for Kobane, though it is not known exactly how many of them are Kurdish . Fighting their own: According to the People's Protection Brigade (YPG) leaders in Kobane, the Kurds are helping decipher radio messages in the Kurdish language and giving ISIS information on the terrain . Most of those fighters, including al-Kurdi, are thought to come from the town of Halabja in Iraq, though some come from Kobane itself, while others arrived from regions such as Afrin and Jazeera. Islamic State websites recently published photographs of him - a young bearded man - wearing the traditional Kurdish dress of baggy pants standing in front of dead Kurdish soldiers. In Baghdad, an Iraqi security official said al-Kurdi was a member of Ansar al-Islam, a Sunni militant group with ties to al-Qaeda leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed in 2006. Al-Kurdi served with the group for years, and later joined the Islamic State group, the official said. The Iraqi official said al-Kurdi is wanted by Iraqi authorities, but refused to give his real name. He added: 'Our latest information is that he is in Syria fighting in the Kobane area. He is an expert in mountainous areas. 'He is commanding the Kurdish group within Daesh [an Arabic name for ISIS] because he is a Kurd.' Reports from inside the city suggest that ISIS troops have already begun beheading civilians in areas they control, meaning the Kurdish fighters are helping in the massacre of their own people. Slaughter: According to witnesses, ISIS fighters have already beheaded civilians in the parts of Kobane they control, and Kurdish fighters (pictured) fear thousands more may die if the whole city falls . Turncoat: While most Kurdish ISIS fighters have come from outside the city, there are some who have been drawn from Kobane itself (pictured, a YPG fighter launches a mortar shell at ISIS troops) The U.N. has warned that, as in Sinjar and Mosul, thousands more could be slaughtered if ISIS win full control of Kobane. Halabja is a predominantly Kurdish town in the north of Iraqi which gained notoriety after Saddam Hussein bombed it with chemical weapons  in 1988, killing some 5,000 people. Shorsh Hassan, a  spokesman for the People's Protection Units (YPG) in Kobane, said: 'The fighter  from Kobane is not like someone who hails from Chechnya with no idea about tracks and roads.' YPG officials say they became aware of Kurds among the mostly Sunni Muslim extremists early in the fighting. As Kurdish fighters were defending the nearby Syrian village of Shiran in September, two Kurdish men with different accents and wearing YPG uniforms infiltrated their ranks, Kurdish officials said. They were captured and upon questioning they admitted to fighting for the Islamic State group, the officials added. Thousands of militants from all over the world - including north Africans, Asians and Westerners - have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the ranks of the Islamic State group. Turkish nationals are among their number, but it is unknown if any are fighting in Kobane. Bloody: The seven-week battle for Kobane has seen extensive airstrikes by America and its coalition partners - including the UK - and is the longest and deadliest battle in Islamic State's campaign so far . Informants: Two Kurdish ISIS fighters infiltrated the ranks of the YPG (pictured) during the fight for Shiran in September, but they were captured and admitted to spying . Halabja was known as  the home of Abdullah Goran, one of the best-known Kurdish poets in the 20th century, and used to be largely non-religious. But in the past three decades, radical Muslim preachers have become active there and turned it into one of Iraqi Kurdistan's most conservative areas. Kiwan Mohammed, the 25-year-old goalkeeper of Halabja's soccer team, was killed last month  while fighting for the Islamic State group in Kobane - to the shock of many Iraqis. Mohammed was identified by jihadi websites as Abu Walid al-Kurdi. According to reports, the athlete left Syria in July 2013 and had not been heard of until his death. Some 70 Iraqi Kurds, mostly from Halabja, went to fight in Syria with the Islamic State group, according to Dana Jalal, a journalist who follows jihadist groups. Most go through Turkey where they say they are going for tourism, but they then they cross into Syria, with some taking their families with them. Nawaf Khalil, the Europe-based spokesman for Syria's powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party, said Kurdish fighters within the Islamic State group are invaluable in the Kobane battle because they know the geography, the language and the mentality of fellow Kurds. He said: 'A main part of their work is tapping (electronic surveillance) and intelligence-gathering. They might be also using some from the Kobane area to benefit from the geographical knowledge of the area.' Mustafa Bali, a Kurdish activist in Kobane, said that by having Kurdish fighters, Islamic State extremists are trying to win the hearts and minds of Syrian Kurds in the area. He added: 'Daesh is trying to tell the people of Kobane that it does not consider them enemies and its fighters include Kurds.'",

In the past, she had prayed that the cardinals wouldn't pick him. \"During the previous conclave, I was praying for him not to be elected ... because I didn't want my brother to leave,\" she told CNN en Espa\u00c3\u00b1ol on Monday. \"It's a position that was a little selfish.\" But this time around, Bergoglio said she changed her tone. \"I prayed that the Holy Spirit would intervene and not listen to me. And it didn't listen to me,\" she said, laughing. \"It did what it wanted.\" Last week, soon after the white smoke billowed out from the Sistine Chapel chimney, she heard her brother's voice crackling through the telephone line. \"I almost died,\" she said. \"The telephone rang and my son answered. I heard him say, 'ooooh, God.' I couldn't believe it.\" Her brother, who chose the name Pope Francis, told her not to worry and reassured her he was well -- something she's also seen watching his face as the events of recent days unfolded on television. \"I told him I wanted to hug him,\" she said, \"and he told me that we are already embracing from a distance, which is also something that I feel and that is real.\" Then, the pope told her to pass along his warm greetings to the rest of the family. \"He said, 'I cannot call everyone. We are a very big family, so please send them my love. Because if I call everyone, it will empty the Vatican coffers,' \" Bergoglio said. Standing outside her house in a middle-class area about 45 minutes from Argentina's capital, she laughed Monday as she described his comments. She said it was a sign that even now, thousands of miles away in Europe and in the highest office in the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, her brother showed the same sense of humor he displayed since their childhood growing up in Argentina. \"I think that's why he became pope ... if he had to be firm in something, he was,\" she said. \"But he was always like that, with a sense of humor.\" It's clear, Bergoglio said, that her brother -- the first pope from Latin America -- will be a pope for the masses. \"I feel like the church opened its doors, and said to the world, \"Here I am. I belong to everyone. I am not from one continent, but absolutely belong to everyone.'\" She dismissed concerns raised by critics who accuse Francis of being complicit with Argentina's brutal military dictatorship from the 1970s -- an accusation the Catholic Church denies. \"I am sure, and that is where my calmness is born, that my brother didn't participate in that,\" she said. \"I don't like to get involved in destructive and scandalous matters. Those rumors are destructive and my purpose is to construct,\" she said. \"So let them say what they want.\" Why Francis? New pope explains his new name .

A former New York City assistant district attorney and philanthropist has died after falling in a Florida horse jumping competition. Anne Heyman, 52, died in Wellington, Florida, on Friday after a fall at the Palm Beach International Equestrian Center at about 10:30 a.m. She was flown to Delray Medical Center, where she died three hours later. Heyman was born in South Africa and attended the George Washington School of Law. She went on to work for the Manhattan district attorney's office and later led the creation of the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village, a community for children orphaned during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Beloved: Anne Heyman was a mother to three biological children and a mother-figure to hundreds of Rwandan children whose lives she changed . Mourning: Current and former residents of the Agahozo-Shalom Village are devastated by Heyman's death . 'Each of us grieves not only for the passing of a tremendous woman and a true visionary, but also for the loss suffered by her family,' the organization said in an announcement posted on its website. 'She has made a remarkable impact on this world and we will continue to work to uphold her legacy.' Rwandan officials also mourned her loss. 'Deeply saddened by sudden passing of Anne Heyman,' wrote Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo in a message on Twitter. 'I know she lives on in many vibrant Rwandan girls she worked hard for.' Heyman and her husband, Seth Merrin, were inspired to help Rwandan orphans after hearing about their struggles at a talk about the genocide in 2005. Heyman was reminded of the residential living communities built in Israel for orphans of the Holocaust and wanted to bring a similar model to Rwanda, according to the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village's website. According to the Wall Street Journal, Agahozo Shalom is a combination of Hebrew and Kinyarwanda languages meaning 'a place to dry one's tears and live in peace.' Legacy: Heyman leaves behind the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village where orphaned children can live and go to high school . 'Big Momma': Staff at the village say devastated children are asking why God would take their mothers away from them twice . High places: Anne Heyman with Israeli President Shimon Peres (second left), Ran Goshen (second right), and her husband Seth Merrin (right) The first 125 students moved in to the village in 2008. The organization is now home to 500 children. Heyman is survived by her husband, Seth Merrin, their three children and hundreds of Rwandan orphans, who called her 'Big Momma.' Heyman and Merrin raised $12 million to build the village outside Kigali in eastern Rwanda. 'It\u2019s the worst thing that could happen to us - again,' Emmanuel Nkundunkundiye, 21, a recent graduate told the Forward from the campus outside the Rwanda capital of Kigali. 'It\u2019s like being made an orphan all over again.' Heyman visited the village every two or three months and would live there with the children for weeks at a time. Just two weeks ago, Heyman presided over the school\u2019s graduation ceremony, which also marked the 20th anniversary of the 1994 killing spree in which hundreds of thousands were killed. Generous: Heyman and her husband raised $12 million to establish the village for orphaned teenagers . Recent visit: Heyman attended a graduation ceremony at the Rwandan youth village just two weeks ago . The children who have been there three or four years knew her very well and felt like she wasn\u2019t only a grandmother to them, but also a guardian angel in some ways,' board member Lisa Issroff told the Palm Beach Post. 'She was an extraordinarily compassionate person to everyone, but in particular for people that were vulnerable.' In a bio on the organization's website, Heyman is described as 'an avid equestrian and competition show jumper' who lived in Manhattan with her husband and three children. Compassion: Heyman had a special affinity with vulnerable people and children . She fell Friday during a master's jumper competition, FTI Consulting Winter Equestrian Festival spokeswoman Jennifer Wood told the Palm Beach Post. Deputies said Saturday Heyman became dislodged from the horse after a jump and began leaning to the left side. The horse began to pick up speed and Heyman fell off. Witnesses told investigators Heyman struck the back of her head. She died from cardiac arrest while undergoing emergency surgery. Funeral details are expected to be shared in the coming days.",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a middle school student:\n\nIn a world where computers are increasingly powerful and are concealed within ever more glossy slabs of aluminum, the Raspberry Pi (RPi) offers surprising proof for the virtue of moderation. Resembling little more than a credit card-sized scrap of exposed circuit board, the RPi is a fully programmable PC that runs a free, open-source Linux operating system, plugs into any TV, can power 3D graphics, connects to the Internet and, with a little ingenuity, be used to create your own personalized robot slave. The computer's miniature frame is crowded with two USB ports, an SD card slot, an Ethernet connection and microchip in the middle -- all powered by a universal USB mobile charger. Read related: Robotics kit for grown-up kids . Not only is it the world's smallest personal computer but, perhaps most importantly of all, at just $25 the RPi is also the world's cheapest. Eben Upton, the UK-based University of Cambridge professor and inventor behind the wallet-friendly PC, says he set out to create a computer so affordable that every child in Britain could have one. With its rough-around-the-edges aesthetic, however, he didn't expect it to catch on very fast and, in the early days of development, set a sales target of 10,000 units within his lifetime. But when the RPi launched in February of this year, demand far outran supply, and all 10,000 sold out immediately -- crashing the distributing websites in the process. Read related: The Rubik's Cube in numbers . It turned out there was a voracious appetite -- particularly among a growing class of DIY geeks -- for a cheap, easily-programmable, open-source piece of hardware that would allow them to let their imaginations run wild. The RPi has since be used to power everything from home-made jukeboxes to baby monitors to miniature near-space crafts and digital weather-stations. Now, far exceeding its inventor's original estimates, the RPi is set to sell as a million units within its first year of availability. In a revealing interview with CNN, Upton tells all about why everyone wants a slice of Raspberry Pi. CNN: What inspired you to invent the Raspberry Pi? Eben Upton: A group of us here at the University of Cambridge were involved in trying to find 17, 18-year-olds to come and study computer science and what we found every year was a reduction in the numbers. We went from 500 people in the 1990s applying for our 80 places, down to under 250  and, worse than that, the sorts of things those children knew how to do when they came in the door were much less impressive. Really Raspberry Pi is an attempt to try and reboot some of that 1980s computer industry feel that had been responsible for giving us this stream of very talented students. CNN: What in your view are the Pi's most distinguishing qualities? EU: I think we really have to say the big, distinct feature about Raspberry Pi is the cost. This is a device that comes in two variants, one that cost $25 and one that costs $35. These are designed to be the same price as a textbook; they're designed to be cheap enough that a child can buy on with their pocket money. They're designed to be cheap enough that you could equip a whole classroom for under a $1000. So, really the cheapness. Almost everything you can do with a Raspberry Pi, you can do with a conventional PC, but you'd be doing it at 10 times the cost. CNN: Did you have any idea what kind of response you'd get? EU: Absolutely not, I think the response has been staggering. Even a year ago we were thinking of this shifting 10,000 units over a lifetime. All we wanted was a few hundred more students -- or for the students we were getting to have had a little more experience when they came to the door. CNN: What was your own reaction when you heard how many you'd sold on the first day? EU: Terror, I guess. When you've scaled everything for a particular size and then you discover you have this enormous spike of demand, then you're always going to wonder if you can fill it. And there were big queues, there were back orders for months after that as we and our partners worked very hard to try and scale out production. CNN: You set out to sell primarily to schools for use by children in class, who's it actually being bought by? EU: Until September, it was being bought almost entirely by people like me -- technically literate adults who wanted to use it to do interesting projects. You know this is something you can plug your television into and play videos on; it's got stuff you can use to control a robot. For people like me this is gold dust. From September onwards we've started to see a swing round towards what we were hoping for, which is educational engagement -- individual children buying them and schools buying classroom sets of them. CNN: Any other surprise takers? EU: We're also starting to see some industrial applications. We're seeing people who have been buying $300 industrial computers saying \"hang on a second, why am I buying this special purpose computer when I can buy one of these. It does the same thing, it runs Unix. My software engineers can be very comfortable with it, why don't I just switch over to these?\" Another really interesting one that I should have anticipated was of course the developing world. These make very good entry-level productivity computers for the developing world, so we're starting to see an interest there as well. CNN: How are you able to sell it so cheaply? EU: One of things that allows us to hit our very low price point is that we have a very high level of integration -- there's just not that much stuff on the board. All of the main features are integrated onto the chip in the middle. It's our central processor and also our graphic processor that drives the display and does some of our peripheral functions, so that's the main chip. CNN: Do you remember the first time you took it into a school and what kind of reaction you got? EU: We were really surprised by the reaction we got. School kids today are used to their tablets and their mobile phones, so we thought we were going to have to put into a shiny box. But one of the biggest reactions from the children was because they could actually see it and point to it and tell what the different bits do. Normally you don't get to see the green stuff and they really love that, there's been such a positive response.",

But it's a fight the outspoken advocate of stricter gun laws says he's determined to win. \"Getting rid of assault weapons, that is a tougher sell, and that's what we've really got to work on,\" Bloomberg said in an interview with CNN's AC360\u00c2\u00b0. \"I'm optimistic, but it's tougher.\" Bloomberg said he's encouraging the roughly 800 mayors who are members of his Mayors Against Illegal Guns organization to start lobbying lawmakers and \"explain to them why constituents really want this done.\" Speaking a day after President Barack Obama announced a list of proposals to reduce gun violence, Bloomberg said the package -- which calls on Congress to reinstate the assault weapons ban, restrict ammunition magazines and expand background checks for gun buyers -- is \"reasonably comprehensive.\" And even though parts of the proposal will face an uphill battle, he said, that doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile fight. Obama-backed gun bills considered a longshot in Congress . \"There are lives involved here. And if you can save one life, isn't that worth trying?\" Bloomberg said. \"And I always thought that you should address issues when they're on the public's conscience, while they're being covered by the press, and you should try to do a complete job so you don't have to go back again and again and again.\" Poll: Gun control support wanes . Republicans immediately rejected the Obama proposals as an attack on the constitutional right to bear arms. \"Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook,\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said in a statement. \"That's probably true,\" Bloomberg acknowledged on Thursday. \"But that doesn't mean that having fewer guns around isn't a better idea.\" Under New York's stricter gun laws, he said, the city has seen murder and suicide rates that are lower than the national average. Last week, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told AC360\u00c2\u00b0 that the evidence in Chicago tells a different story. A look at U.S. gun laws . \"Chicago has very strict gun laws. It is also the deadliest city in America,\" Gingrich said. Asked Thursday about Gingrich's observation, Bloomberg said gun laws aren't a panacea. \"There's no one solution to this,\" he said. \"This is, however, a very important step. Fewer guns means fewer murders. Fewer guns means fewer suicides. Fewer guns means you and your children are safer.\" Since last month's shooting massacre at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, Bloomberg and his group have been at the forefront of a push for stricter gun laws. Opinion: A father's murder, a plea on gun control . He's said that more than 1 million people have signed a petition backed by the organization to tighten gun control laws in the wake of the Newtown shooting rampage. The group has spent millions on television spots calling for gun control, including an ad that ran nationally this week, featuring family members of victims killed by gun violence repeating the word, \"enough.\" On Thursday, Bloomberg sharply criticized the National Rifle Association for its approach to the gun control debate. After blaming video games for the Newtown shooting rampage, the organization released its own gun-related mobile video game. And on Tuesday night, the NRA released an ad accusing Obama of hypocrisy for being \"skeptical\" about placing armed guards at schools, when his two daughters are protected by the U.S. Secret Service. That was \"bad P.R.\" and an \"outrage,\" Bloomberg said. \"I think it's just a bad strategy,\" he said, \"and they're going to lose this battle.\" CNN's Mark Preston, Dana Bash, Jessica Yellin and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.

The Arizona governor has spent the last few years locked in legal battles with the Obama administration mainly over provisions in her state's strict immigration bill, SB1070.

This week, a federal court went against Brewer's efforts to deny driver's licenses to young undocumented immigrants known as 'dreamers,' according to\u00a0Fox News. During her time in office, Brewer worked tirelessly to shore up the Arizona-Mexico border, but called it one of her biggest disappointments that she hadn't been able to do more. She said she wanted to make it a crime for immigrants to be in Arizona without the proper documentation, but that proposal was struck down too.

Jennifer Mee, 19, was arrested and charged Sunday -- as were two men, Laron Raiford and Lamont Newton -- hours after Shannon Griffin was found dead. He had been shot several times. The victim \"friended\" Mee on a social networking site last week and the two exchanged messages in subsequent days, according to St. Petersburg, Florida, police. Authorities do not believe Mee or Griffin, a Wal-Mart employee who had recently moved to Florida from the Gulf Coast, knew each other prior to their online encounter. After telling family members around 10 p.m. that he was heading out to meet a woman, Griffin rode his scooter to a vacant home where he had his first face-to-face encounter with Mee, police said. Mee led Griffin around to the back, where Raiford and Newton were armed and waiting, according to police. Griffin was shot with .38-caliber revolver while struggling in what the three murder suspects described to police as a \"robbery gone awry.\" \"All three suspects admitted to their involvement and were charged with first-degree felony murder,\" St. Petersburg Police Sgt. T.A. Skinner said in a statement. Mee will face the same murder charge as the two men, even though she didn't actually shoot Griffin, police said. \"She was well aware of what was going on,\" St. Petersburg, Florida, Police Chief Chuck Harmon said. \"She was obviously the set-up person in this robbery.\" In 2007, Mee's non-stop hiccups gained national attention. She earned the nickname \"Hiccup Girl\" and appeared multiple times on NBC's \"Today\" show. Her desperate search for a hiccup cure included trying \"sugar, peanut butter, breathing in a bag, having people scare me,\" she said in a photo slideshow posted on the St. Petersburg Times' website in February 2007. But after her hiccups faded, Mee continued to draw attention. In June 2007, local media reported that she ran away from home. In January 2010, St. Petersburg police once again issued a missing person report for Mee. Her mother told CNN affiliate WFTS that her daughter had stormed off after getting into a fight with her boyfriend. Mee was found after a friend called police, the affiliate said. Mee had been living with Raiford and Newton, police said. Police arrived at the scene of Saturday's shooting shortly after 11 p.m, finding a gun in some of the suspects' clothing, Harmon said. The three suspects were arrested and charged Sunday, after they were \"cooperative\" in talking with police. In an interview with WFLZ radio, the teenager's mother, Rachel Robidoux, described her daughter as a gentle, somewhat naive person who had never before gotten into trouble. Her life had taken a turn for the worse, Robidoux said, ever since her bout with the hiccups. \"It wasn't a case of the hiccups, it was a curse of the hiccups,\" she said. She called Mee's arrest \"a nightmare.\" Also on WFLZ, Griffin's ex-girlfriend Rachel Hagabone said the victim was a good man. \"All he ever wanted to do was make somebody happy,\" she said. \"He's the nicest guy ever.\" St. Petersburg police described Griffin, who had no criminal record, as somewhat of a \"social introvert\" who lived with a cousin and was often on the computer. Besides his online encounter, he did not appear to know any of the suspects, police said. \"This is the far end of the spectrum, as far as something that could happen\" with social networking websites, said Harmon. \"The message: Be careful who you're having a conversation with online. You never know.\" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.",

With half an hour remaining and a fiery contest goalless, he turned to a 17-year-old Geordie playing for the first time in the fixture. Adam Armstrong was the romance card. Still without score some 15 minutes later, he gambled. Off came midfield enforcer Cheick Tiote to be replaced by Papiss Cisse, the half-fit striker who only needs half a chance to score a goal. He got one and missed. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has not taken a single point from his last four meetings with Sunderland . Sunderland winger Adam Johnson scored a late goal to seal a 1-0 win against rivals Newcastle United . Johnson is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring the dramatic winner against Alan Pardew's side . Then came the Joker, \u00a312million flop Remy Cabella was introduced as Pardew played his final hand. Within two minutes it was Sunderland having the last laugh, exposing gaping holes in Newcastle\u2019s midfield to break with unforgiving efficiency. Adam Johnson was the match-winner and, for the first time in derby history, a Newcastle manager had lost four on the bounce. The withdrawal of Tiote afforded Johnson the space to exploit. Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet knew as much, but was too canny to gloat. \u2018I think Alan was brave, very, very brave,\u2019 said the Uruguayan. \u2018He put on as many strikers as he could to win the game and for 10 or 15 minutes, they gave us plenty of problems. \u2018It was a very good and brave move from Alan. Now because of that, we were able to break and score the goal. With the game goalless and Pardew desperate for a winner, Gus Poyet's men capitalsed on some questionable managerial decisions from his opposite number . Poyet celebrates emphatically following Johnson's late goal against local rivals Newcastle at St James' Park . Johnson raises his arms in victory in front of the travelling Sunderland supporters at St James' Park . \u2018It's unfair, but sometimes in football that happens. You put plenty of forward players on and you win it 2-0 or 3-0, or it can go the other way.\u2019 There had, in fairness, been chances to win it for the hosts \u2013 Armstrong shot when he should have crossed to the unmarked Moussa Sissoko and Ayoze Perez was thwarted by Costel Pantilimon. Pardew even started one move himself with a half-volley down the touchline in an attempt to hurry a throw-in, but the efforts of he and his team were to end in despair, again. The Newcastle boss admits it was a case of misadventure. \u2018We were always liable to overcommit,\u2019 he said. \u2018If we had one fault it was overcommitting in the end period of the game where you have to be disciplined, particularly given the history of this fixture where Sunderland have caught us on the break before and they have done it again.\u2019 He did, though, defend the motivation behind the changes. Pardew called upon 17-year-old Adam Armstrong to play for the first time in the notoriously feisty fixture . The Magpies manager also brought off midfield custodian Cheik Tiote to bring on striker Papiss Cisse . \u2018This club wants to see goals and I would never be manager here and accept a draw at home,\u2019 he said. \u2018We should still have the discipline in the team regardless of how many offensive players we have on. \u2018If ever we were going to lose a game then do it in that manner, trying to push for a win. As much as we tried to, we just couldn\u2019t get the goal.\u2019 Brave, meanwhile, would be the best way to describe Steven Taylor\u2019s headed clearance from the goal-line in the second half which kept the game level but was at the expense of a bloodied cheek when he clattered into the post. \u2018Steven is hurting physically and mentally,\u2019 said Pardew. \u2018He had a couple of stitches but he\u2019ll be okay.\u2019 After three defeats in eight days, will Newcastle be okay? Next up is a trip to Manchester United on Boxing Day. \u2018This compounds the defeats at Arsenal and Spurs. We have to lick our wounds and prepare quickly for Manchester United,\u2019 added Pardew. \u2018We\u2019re still in a healthy position in the league. \u2018It\u2019s painful but this disappointment is different to what it felt like earlier in the season \u2013 you can see that our players gave everything.\u2019 In giving everything, however, they ended up with nothing.",

Using data from the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter's Lend tool, Nasa scientists have been mapping the hydrogen levels across the moon craggy deposits. And they've found surprisingly higher levels of hydrogen in a very specific area; the slopes of craters in the moon's southern hemisphere facing the South Pole. Nasa scientists have found surprisingly higher levels of hydrogen in a very specific area; the slopes of craters in the moon's southern hemisphere facing the South Pole. Pictured is a Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter mage of the moon's Hayn Crater, located just northeast of Mare Humboldtianum . These slopes could be mankind's best hope finding drinkable water on the lunar surface, they claim. Hydrogen could be found as either hydroxol - which is a single atom bound with a single oxygen atom \u2014 or it may be two hydrogen atoms bound with oxygen. Scientists believe lunar water could be used for drinking or its components \u2013 hydrogen and oxygen \u2013 may be used to manufacture rocket fuel or even breathable air. 'There's an average of about 23 parts-per-million-by-weight (ppmw) more hydrogen on Pole-Facing Slopes (PFS) than on Equator-Facing Slopes (EFS),' said Nasa scientist, Timothy McClanahan. This is the first time a widespread difference in the spread of hydrogen on the moon has been detected. Using data from the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter's Lend tool (artist's impression pictured), Nasa scientists have been mapping the hydrogen levels across the moon's surface . The cause of the discrepancy between PFS and EFS may be similar to how the sun move or redistributes frozen water from warmer to colder places on the surface of the Earth. There are different possible sources for the hydrogen on the moon. Comets and some asteroids contain large amounts of water, and impacts by these objects may bring hydrogen to the moon. Hydrogen-bearing molecules could also be created on the lunar surface by interaction with the solar wind. The solar wind is a thin stream of gas that's constantly blown off the sun. Most of it is hydrogen, and this hydrogen may interact with oxygen in silicate rock and dust on the moon to form hydroxyl and possibly water molecules. After these molecules arrive at the moon, it is thought they get energized by sunlight and then bounce across the lunar surface; and they get stuck, at least temporarily, in colder and more shadowy areas. 'Here in the northern hemisphere, if you go outside on a sunny day after a snowfall, you'll notice that there's more snow on north-facing slopes because they lose water at slower rates than the more sunlit south-facing slopes' said McClanahan. 'We think a similar phenomenon is happening with the volatiles on the moon \u2013 PFS don't get as much sunlight as EFS, so this easily vapourised material stays longer and possibly accumulates to a greater extent on PFS.' Slopes closer to the South Pole show a larger hydrogen concentration difference. Broader slopes provide stronger hydrogen signals than smaller slopes. Since the 1960s scientists thought that only in permanently shadowed areas in craters near the lunar poles was it cold enough to accumulate this volatile material, but these results suggest that hydrogen on the moon is more widespread. At the moment, however, it's uncertain if the hydrogen is abundant enough to economically mine. 'The amounts we are detecting are still drier than the driest desert on Earth,' said McClanahan. The team now wants to see if the hydrogen abundance changes with the transition from day to night. If so, it would back up existing evidence of a very active production and cycling of hydrogen on the lunar surface, according to McClanahan. Since the 1960s scientists thought that only shadowed areas in craters near the lunar poles was it cold enough to accumulate this volatile material, but these results suggest that hydrogen on the moon is more widespread .",

But production levels are \"insignificant,\" Lonmin executive vice president Mark Munroe said at a news conference after the announcement. \"To all intents and purposes, we are not producing ore,\" he said, acknowledging that the company will not meet platinum production targets for the year. The mood at the mine was \"stable but tense\" Monday, police said, after a strike over pay that has been marked by terrible violence. About 3,000 drillers and assistant drillers at the mine in South Africa went on strike on August 10. The miners, who earn $300 to $500 a month, want their salaries raised to $1,500 a month. Lonmin, the world's third-largest producer of platinum, said no to the increase and called the strike illegal. Almost a third of the workers at the Lonmin mine came to work Monday, the company-imposed deadline for strikers to return to their jobs. Munroe, the company executive, said Lonmin believed that most of the workers who stayed away had been intimidated, not because they were on strike. The company withdrew a threat to fire workers who did not come to work Monday, it said, following meetings with union representatives, and gave the striking workers an extra day to return. Last week, police fired on striking miners, killing 34 workers and wounding 78. They also arrested 259 on various charges, including malicious damage to property, armed robbery, illegal gathering and possession of weapons. Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega has said police \"were forced to utilize maximum force to defend themselves.\" An executive with the Solidarity union Monday blamed violent protests at the mine on \"opportunists\" exploiting the strike. \"The protestors' violent behavior, the brutal murders of innocent people and the use of witch doctors and traditional murder weapons rather indicate a political motivation and opportunistic positioning instead of an attempt to negotiate a solution,\" said Gideon du Plessis, deputy general secretary of Solidarity. The striking rock drill operators belong to another union called AMCU. Lonmin said Sunday it was telling nonstriking workers that \"police consider it safe to report for duty again\" Monday morning and was ordering strikers to go back to work or face possible dismissals. Facing the ultimatum, one South African drill operator told CNN that he and his co-workers should honor their slain colleagues and hold out for a pay increase. \"Otherwise, they will have died in vain,\" Cingisile Makhaba said Sunday. Cyril Ramaphosa, an African National Congress executive committee member who owns shares in the mine, is donating $250,000 to pay for the funerals of those killed last week. But Makhaba said the money is \"of no use now. It won't bring back the dead.\" \"Where is this money coming from?\" he asked. \"They should have used it to increase our wages.\" Makhaba lives with his two children in a compound of one-room shacks he shares with eight other families. \"We work hard, but we live like animals,\" he said. Over the weekend, thousands of people gathered outside the platinum mine in anger over the shooting. The situation was calm but tense as police stood near the protest Saturday and helicopters conducted surveillance. The tragedy began unfolding a week ago when miners went on strike demanding pay increases at the mine in Marikana, near Rustenburg, about two hours northwest of Johannesburg. \"When there is a rock fall, it is generally the drillers who are the victims,\" wrote journalist Greg Marinovich in the Daily Maverick newspaper. \"It is the most dangerous job in the business.\" The violence is thought to have been sparked by a rivalry between two unions that wield a lot of power and influence in South Africa. The unions, accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages, denied instigating the clashes. Tensions at Marikana had mounted throughout the week. The striking miners carried traditional panga machetes and gathered Thursday around a small hill. By then, at least 10 other people were dead from incidents that had occurred in the days before. Among them were two police officers who were hacked to death. Journalists who were at Marikana said police seemed to be fed up with the miners and determined to resolve the issue. \"Yesterday the police were clear that today we are going to disarm them and remove them from the hill because the gathering is illegal,\" Xolile Mngambi, a reporter for CNN affiliate ETV, said Friday. By Thursday afternoon, another round of negotiations among the striking miners, the unions and Lonmin had failed. A heavily armed police tactical response team moved in to disperse the miners. To hear Phiyega, the police commissioner, describe it, the police weighed all their options and decided to fence in the miners with barbed wire -- to compartmentalize them into more manageable groups. \"The armed protesters moved toward the police,\" she said. \"They were driven back with tear gas and rubber bullets. But when they fired, police used maximum force.\" But journalists at the scene could not say whether the protesters fired first. \"We cannot say to you the police were provoked,\" Mngambi said. Then, police unleashed a barrage of gunfire. One witness said it went on for three minutes.",

That rather meandered along in the second half but Diego Simeone will be delighted. Atletico - thanks to substitute Arda Turan's late goal - have recorded back-to-back victories at the Bernabeu for the first time in their history. Cristiano Ronaldo had levelled earlier from the spot after Tiago gave Atletico the lead, but Real never got a head of steam. Problems for Carlo Ancelotti going forward. Click the link above to read Pete Jenson's full match report. Into stoppage time... only two minutes!! Greizmann should've finished it! Did Pepe a kipper down the right but only fires int the sidenetting! Big, big chance. Suarez yellow card after bringing down Modric. Are we to get a quality ball in? Kroos... and Moya wanders out to collect. Deary me. Miranda has a yellow to his name now as Real Madrid push forward... free-kick on the edge of the box, right-hand side. James Rodriguez must step up and deliver. Clipped in with no conviction. Awful. Booking for Modric now as the visitors stand over a decent set piece here. Wasted though. Five minutes to go. 83mins: Ronaldo now shooting from anywhere. Desperate for Real Madrid, this, and Atletico will just throw bodies in front of those efforts. If Atletico\u00a0manage to hang on for the next ten minutes it'll be the first time ever they've won consecutive league matches at the Bernabeu. Real look to be lacking ideas here, worryingly for Carlo Ancelotti. Good area on the right. Needs a delivery... but Kroos' centre is palmed away by Moya. Well, I did say it suited Atletico and it's Arda Turan who's put the visitors back in front! A nice stepover by Raul Garcia inside the box and the substitute sweeps into the far corner. Wonderful, wonderful passed finish. Those 50 (yes, fifty) travelling fans are delirious. This has opened up somewhat, which suits Atletico on the counter you would've thought. And Arda Turan again! Juanfran's whipped cross isn't met by the substitute and Arbeloa heads over for a corner. Chance! Arda Turan cuts in from the left, opens his body up and just drives wide! 72mins: Here comes Isco, replacing the largely ineffectual Gareth Bale. Into the final 20 minutes now and we've barely had a chance after the break. I won't lie, this has disappointed me since eight o'clock. And how Hernandez picks up a yellow card. This is ridiculous! Seven for the night. Javier Hernandez, by the way, scored on his debut for his previous two clubs. Arbeloa in the book now! It's not been that kind of game really. Changes: Hernandez on for Benzema and Greizmann is on for Gimenez. Real panic stations with Ramos at the back who hacks for a needless corner. Godin gets above his marker - Pepe, incidentally - at the back post but nods over. Chance for Bale but his header floats into Moya's arms. Rodriguez's centre was too drifty and behind Bale. Meanwhile, Arda Turan is coming on for the booked Gabi. A little bit niggly here. Atletico trying to slow the game down, but they have a free-kick in an advantageous position. Ah, but it comes to nothing. They aren't potent enough, with Mandzukic not wining enough in the air. 54mins: Booking for Gabi, who tactically hauls down Rodriguez as he rampaged on the counter. Clever. Bit of territory for Atletico now. Juanfran launches a throw-in towards the six-yard box but the hosts easily clear. 51mins: And there's another from way out - this time from Pepe - that flies over. Tepid start. 47mins: First shot in anger during this second half and it comes from James Rodriguez who blasts over from 30 yards. Right, here we go. Will Atletico come out more? They kick us back off and clear to touch. Ominous. The referee has blown slightly early there. Bit odd. Anyway, Tiago gave Atletico the lead with a superb near post header early doors before Ronaldo bought - then scored - a penalty to level it up. Real have been guilty of missing a number of opportunities and should be leading here. Atletico have - somewhat disappointingly - sat in and absorbed too much pressure here. Was expecting them to come out a little bit more. Mandzukic in the book for a late one in midfield as Real win a corner. Pepe tries to steer towards the back post but nothing comes of it, despite Ronaldo's best efforts. They're getting closer though... Benzema tries to make amends for that fluff before but slides an effort wide after nicely cutting inside on the edge. Can't have helped that half the Bernabeu were jeering him as he shaped to shoot. Madness. Horrible touch Benzema! Ronaldo streams forward on the left, plays in the Frenchman who has all the time in the word but he miscontrols and Moya is out to thwart him. Really poor, that. Well, I expected Real to flood forward after the goal but it's been a fairly subdued five minutes or so. Ronaldo doesn't miss many, and he sends Moya the wrong way to level it up. Cool as you like. Game on! Ronaldo goes over the challenge of\u00a0Siqueira and it's given! Could barely hear the whistle and it's barely a foul. Think Ronaldo has bought that. Godin hauls down Ronaldo on the edge and picks up a booking for his troubles. Good area this... Ronaldo over it. Surprise, surprise. Oh, no! It's Bale! And what a save by Moya, diving to his left to deny the Welshman. Vicious dip and swerve. Poor from Gabi, who gives away the ball in his own third, but Real cannot capitalise - largely because two or three defenders then harry to win back possession. Tame header is comfortably saved. The Bernabeu is a touch restless. James Rodriguez is in the book for protesting after not being awarded what appeared to be a clear free-kick on the edge. Harsh. Juanfran marauds down the right and earns a corner. Can Real defend? They struggle again but Benzema eventually hooks away. Very nervy at the back. Chance for James Rodriguez - teed up by Ronaldo - but he can't direct a tricky volley towards goal. The Colombian struck it into the ground and it bounces harmlessly over. You fancy that Real need a quick reply. 14mins: Ronaldo looks a touch miffed at that early goal, drives at the away area, but flashes an effort over the top. Good from Siqueira down the left... corner... and GOAL! Thiago was ignored at the near post - Coentrao, Benzema and Ronaldo the guilty parties - and he nods home from a wicked Koke delivery. First bit of work for Casillas, who plucks a Koke cross out of the air confidently. Different goalkeeper this season! Atletico are superb at pressing high and forcing mistakes. We've seen that already as the visitors turn possession over in Real's third. This is not only one of the biggest clashes in Spain, but on the continent now. I was lucky enough to be in Lisbon for the Champions League final a few months ago and you don't realise how much this particular fixture means until you sample it first-hand. So here we go at the Bernabeu, Real get us underway... Well done all. Casillas; Arbeloa, Pepe, Ramos, Coentrao; Modric, Kroos, James; Bale, Cristiano, Benzema . Moya, God\u00edn, Siqueira, Tiago, Koke, Raul Garcia, Mandzukic, R. Jimenez, Gabi, Juanfran, Miranda . Good evening and welcome to Sportsmail's coverage of the Madrid derby.

It's certainly not everyone's cup of tea and can cause those not used to DIY hours of agonising over missing screws and parts that don't fit as they become increasingly frustrated while putting up their flatpack furniture. But one handyman has now come to their aid after becoming a full time professional flatpacker. Denver Thornton, 36, who studied cabinet making at university, relishes the challenge of piecing together the household goods and says he regularly gets called out by those in a spot of bother. Denver Thornton makes a living by building flatpack furniture for those who struggle with DIY . Mr Thornton, of Beckenham, south east London, said: 'Not everyone has the energy, patience, skills or tools to put together furniture. 'I\u2019ve been trained to do this and I absolutely love it - it\u2019s like playing around with wooden lego. 'People go to IKEA and buy all their furniture, but when they get it home they haven\u2019t the faintest idea of what to do with all the pieces. 'It makes sense for a professional to do it for you - flatpacks are only in a box to get them through your front door, cars start in bits but you wouldn\u2019t try and put one together on your own. 'I get called out by people all the time who are in the middle of building something and it\u2019s about to fall on top of them.' Mr Thornton, who co-owns the furniture assembling company Unflatpack.com with business partner John Griffin, says no job is too big for his expertise. Mr Thornton studied cabinet making at university and says he regularly gets called out by DIY novices . Mr Thornton, of Beckenham, south east London, said: 'Not everyone has the energy, patience, skills or tools to put together furniture' He said: 'Sometimes you\u2019ll walk into a room where someone has tried to assemble the furniture and it\u2019s just a big mess. 'I\u2019ve even had men ask me to finish the job extra quick as they\u2019ve lied to their wives that they\u2019ll assemble it by the time they get home, and they want to take the credit. 'The most difficult piece of furniture to assemble has got to be the IKEA Hemnes day bed - it can be quite tricky as it has lots of components. 'The piece I hate doing the most is the Billy book case. Mr Thornton, who co-owns the furniture assembling company Unflatpack.com with business partner John Griffin, says no job is too big for his expertise . 'It\u2019s just so easy and monotonous, I prefer a challenge. 'There\u2019s only been one time when I wondered if I was ever going to finish a job - a customer had brought a media unit that was huge - 12 by 8 foot and weighed about a quarter of a ton. 'It must have taken about five of us to lift and put together.' Mr Thornton began his interest at the age of ten and started working as a cabinet maker when he left school before going on to study the subject at university. He said: 'I passed with a distinction but I wasn\u2019t sure what to do next so I went to the job centre. 'The lady there told me there was such a job as a flatpack assembler. Mr Thornton began his interest at the age of ten and started working as a cabinet maker when he left school before going on to study the subject at university . 'When I tell people what I do for a living I get one of three reactions. 'The first is shock as they never even knew the service existed, the second is that it sounds like a great business idea, and the third is that they wouldn\u2019t need to hire me as they could do it themselves - they\u2019re usually wrong.' Since Mr Griffin started Unflatpack.com in 2005, the company has gone from strength to strength, and it now works in partnership with some of the biggest homeware brands in the UK. Mr Thornton, who charges \u00a330 an hour for his flatpacking services, said: 'We\u2019re now the official assembly partners for The Range and in talks with other big brands. 'We have a national presence now and have about 150 fitters that cover the whole of the UK.'",

Channel Tunnel services have returned to normal after operators repaired around half a mile of overhead power lines in the tunnel. Passengers have endured two days of delays and cancellations after the overhead problem led to the breakdown of a French-bound shuttle train at around 7.30am yesterday. This led to evacuation of nearly 400 passengers, plus four dogs, who were taken on to France by another shuttle train via the service tunnel. Scroll down for video . Services through the Channel Tunnel have returned to normal after overhead power lines were repaired . Eurostar had to cancel services yesterday and were warning of knock-on delays earlier today . The . tunnel\u2019s high-speed train company Eurostar had to cancel trains . today and yesterday while there were delays to some shuttle services on . both days. Services are returning to normal this afternoon following repairs which Eurotunnel said have taken around 24 hours. The . broken-down shuttle was driven from the site by a diesel locomotive and . brought to the platform in France, where customers were reunited with . their vehicles to continue their onward journeys. Eurotunnel director Yves Szrama said: 'We apologise to our . customers for any disruption that the events yesterday may have caused. The safety of the passengers is always our first concern. 'Once . that is assured, we want them to be comfortable, well informed and well . looked after. The recent installation of mobile telephone services . inside the tunnel helped us keep our customers informed during the . incident'. Earlier . today, four of the high-speed Eurostar train services to the continent . had to be cancelled and there were long delays reported on Folkestone to . Calais shuttle services. After long queues at the Eurotunnel terminal yesterday (pictured), passengers reported delays again today . Many passengers took to Twitter to complain about the four delays to getting on a shuttle train . The delays were made worse by cyclists and their teams crossing the channel for the Tour de France . Eurostar said passengers who had a . booking on a cancelled train could exchange their ticket, free of . charge, for another available service within the next four months. Meanwhile, thousands of people on domestic services were late for work today because of a rail track defect, just 24 hours after Network Rail was fined for missing punctuality targets. Packed trains into Waterloo station in London were delayed because of the problem at Surbiton in Surrey. South West Train station services from Surrey were among those disrupted. There were also delays to CrossCountry and London Midland services in the West Midlands due to a broken-down train. It came after 382 passengers were forced to walk down a service tunnel after their train broke down . The incident blocked one of the channel tunnel's two tracks yesterday, throwing travel plans into chaos . The Channel Tunnel is about 40 metres below the sea bed, has two main tunnels and a central service tunnel connected to both. The south tunnel goes from France to the UK and the north from the UK to France . The south tunnel takes trains from France to the UK and the north tunnel from the UK to France. A smaller service tunnel runs between them and is connected to both at 375 metre intervals. This allows access for maintenance and emergency services and also serves as a safe haven if . passengers need to be evacuated from their train in an incident. In order to deal with blockages, the two main tunnels are each split into three 'intervals'. These . are designed in a way which means that if a train breaks down inside, . services can still run through the length of the tunnel. The tunnel's interval system allows trains to pass through even when one tunnel is blocked . This . is possible because the Channel Tunnel has two undersea crossovers . allowing trains to pass from one tunnel to the other to avoid and . isolate a section of tunnel that is blocked. Yesterday, almost 400 people were walked from interval two in the north tunnel . into the service tunnel and then into a train waiting in interval one in . the the south tunnel. The . train then used a crossover to take it back into interval four and then . along the correct tunnel that nearly always takes services to France. Trains from France to Britain have been taking the same route for ninety . minutes but are then forced to wait as trains from Britain to . France do the same, causing the delays.",

Vladimir Putin is poised to introduce draconian measures to unplug Russia from the Internet in emergencies caused by the 'unpredictable' West, it was claimed yesterday. The web is seen as the last bastion of glasnost - or openness - in Moscow, but now there are fears new curbs will be imposed as they have been on TV and newspapers. The Russian president is summoning a Monday session of his powerful Security Council over the issue. 'Taking into account the complete unpredictability of the United States and European Union, Russia is taking measures to ensure its own security,' Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told AFP. It was vital to act due to 'the unpredictability of our foreign partners', he insisted. He claimed Russia should be 'ready for anything' after the worst rift with the West since the Cold War. Vedomosti newspaper said Russia was aiming to strengthen the 'sovereignty of the Russian segment of the World Wide Web'. This could include powers to unplug Russia from the World Wide Web in 'emergency' situations. These might be protest rallies or military hostilities, the newspaper said citing sources. The web has been a focus of Kremlin criticism over the Ukraine conflict, and the aim would be to prevent it operating internationally in any crisis. The country's citizens would only be able to use a Russian-wide web. This week a major social networking site VKontakte fell completely under the control of a company in the empire of Kremlin-friendly Alisher Usmanov, also a major shareholder of Arsenal Football Club. 'We have a highly reliable backup plan, which maybe discussed at the Security Council meeting,' said a source. The move follows calls from politicians to isolate the Russian web from the US and EU internet which are seen as subversive.

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\n(CNN) -- \"Skyfall,\" the 23rd installment in the James Bond series, one of the longest-running film franchises in history, recently landed at the top of the box office with $87.8 million in ticket sales. It was the largest opening ever for 007 and the fourth largest opening this year, behind \"The Avengers,\" \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" and \"The Hunger Games.\" Ian Fleming's agent has always been a man of wish fulfillment. After all, he brought heat during the chilliest parts of the Cold War and had the requisite women and weapons. Now, Bond is proving that he still has a place at MI6 by tackling a much more modern dilemma: tactical cyberespionage and terrorism. While the methods for wreaking havoc have changed, the confidential case files are as classic as the man's martini. CNN spoke to Morgan Wright, a decorated former law enforcement officer who has done work relating to cyberterrorism for the United States Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense about what \"Skyfall\" gets right and wrong. In the end, the evolving franchise portrays a very real scenario that the United States may soon struggle with from a policy standpoint: When does cyberterrorism necessitate a physical response? Busting Bond: The myths of movie spycraft . (Warning, there are movie spoilers ahead). Information storage . Shaking disbelief: One of the standout moments in \"Skyfall\" is the film's opening sequence in which Bond, played for the third time by Daniel Craig, and field operative Eve, played by Naomie Harris, chase a man through the streets of Istanbul. They're after a hard drive containing confidential information about MI6 agents. It's information that \"Skyfall's\" bad guy Silva, played by Javier Bardem, plans on uploading to YouTube, putting the agents' lives at risk. But how likely would it be for a terrorist to obtain and store this information in one place? Stirring reality: Terrorists and intelligence agencies handle the management and distribution of intelligence in radically different ways, Wright said. \"If you take Osama bin Laden, for example, they're not going to have big classified systems or safeguards that go with that,\" Wright said. It's true that after bin Laden's compound was raided, stashes of flash drives, CDs and tapes were discovered. He had everything in one place. \"That's very consistent when you're not part of the government and you lack the infrastructure to build out a big system that a national security agency does,\" Wright said. \"Bad guys need everything in one place because that's how they operate.\" Unlike the 15 different members of the intelligence community -- ranging from the National Reconnaissance Office to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency \u00e2\u20ac\u201d terrorist groups would be unable to have a secure worldwide network or to participate in cloud computing. However, it's implied that the man they're chasing is more than your common terrorist. He's a man with access. Still, it's unlikely that he would be able to have all of this information in one place. \"It's not very plausible that the government is going to put all of their sensitive information on one hard drive that manages to get stolen because that would be a violation of what they call OPSEC,\" Wright said. When it comes to top secret information, there are special access programs that are very restricted, so, Wright said, it would be virtually impossible for someone to have access to all of that information as \"everything is regulated on the government side.\" Hacking in . Shaking disbelief: While Bond is sipping tequila as everyone assumes he is dead, Silva goes after his main target, M, played once again by Judi Dench. The villain hacks into MI6 to gain control of the agency's gas pipeline, which allows him to target and blow up specific rooms. The act brings Bond out of retirement. But would it be possible for a bad guy to hack into MI6 -- or any infrastructure -- to target it for destruction? Stirring reality: Wright said many critical infrastructures are connected to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems, controlling our electricity grid, water, and sewers, and are therefore are a huge soft target for terrorism. \"Now you can use it for transmissions of data communications that control everything from power in hospitals to controlling the cell doors inside a prison,\" he said, adding that targeting a specific office is highly unlikely. Transportation safety . Shaking disbelief: After hacking into the MI6 mainframe, Silva accesses the London Underground and manages to send one of the Tube's trains off the rails, launching it toward Bond in rapid succession. Would it be possible for Silva to access something like a train, and how much control could he actually have over it? Stirring reality: \"Transportation is one of the softest terrorism targets there is, and quite frankly I'm shocked that public transportation hasn't been targeted more often and that there haven't been more successful attacks,\" Wright said. \"You can create a small explosion or diversion using a computer to change the lights from go to stop or interfering with the traffic control capabilities of the track by overriding a command.\" Wright said. Airlines could also be at risk, the expert said. \"There are some gaping holes in the air traffic control system in terms of being able to access frequencies or being able to talk directly to pilots.\" Still, just like M's office, Wright said the idea that Silva could target a train so quickly and send it to Bond's location is based predominately in fantasy. Snagging the villain . Shaking disbelief: When things get really bad, Bond and M decide the time has come to create a digital trail that will lead Silva directly to them, but they want to make it look like they're actually hiding. This leads them to the final battle in a place called Skyfall, which fans of Ian Fleming's books know as a very personal place for Bond. It's the final showdown and the final act of tactical cyberespionage in the film. However, would anyone ever really need to create a fake geosignal to make someone like Silva think that they're actually hiding from them? Stirring reality: According to Wright you can create a computer network that looks legitimate to someone else but in reality uses its weakness for your own benefit. \"There's actually a term for this in the computer world called 'Honeypots',\" he said. \"When we were concerned about the financial sector, there was actually a project called the Honeypot project. It was a deception project where we created what appeared to be a bank front end, a Web-based front end where transactions were taking place.\" By doing so, Wright and his team were able to see the latest techniques being used and which vulnerabilities cyberterrorists were willing to exploit. \"We looked at how they went about scanning the system, what tools they used, and what vulnerabilities they went after.\" Often, Wright would patch the most obvious vulnerabilities but leave esoteric ones unpatched, allowing hackers to exploit the system as he monitored their behavioral patterns. In the movie, Q explains that if he makes it too easy for Silva to find them, he'll know something is up. Likewise, if the signal is too hard to find, M could possibly remain in hiding. \"People tend to get comfortable using their own techniques, and they use the same approach over and over again,\" Wright explained. \"You can get a profile of an attacker, determine if it was the same group doing something else, and see what methodology they're using.\" Wright said it's a cat-and-mouse game, and \"the old saying is that government has to be right 100%, but the bad guy has only got to be lucky once.\" In the case of the latest film from the 50-year-old Bond franchise, it's safe to assume who comes out on top.",

Chechnya's Interior Ministry said Yusef Muhammed al Emirat, a native of Saudi Arabia, died Thursday during a sting operation in the mountainous district of south Chechnya. He also operated under the name \"Mohanned.\" \"Mohanned was one of the most notorious warlords,\" Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov told reporters in the Chechen capital, Grozny. \"For a long period of time, he was responsible for supplying armed groups with money, training militants and devising plans to commit terrorist acts.\" Russia's National Anti-Terrorist Committee said Mohanned was\"directly involved in virtually every suicide terrorist attack committed in the Russian Federation over the past few years,\" according to intelligence information gained from captured Chechen rebels. According to the Interior Ministry, Mohanned and another rebel, Chechen Ilez Sultygov, were killed on Thursday after security forces approached the men and ordered them to surrender. Police said they responded with machine-gun fire and were killed. No security officers were killed or wounded. Rebels in Chechnya started out fighting for independence in the 1990s, but in recent years, the fight has been aimed more at imposing Islamist rule and asserting their authority in the area. The fight has exacted a heavy toll in the North Caucasus region where Chechnya is located, and has now spread to other regions of Russia. The standard of living in the southwestern republic is poor compared with the rest of Russia. Unemployment is rampant and infant mortality is high. In addition, the Chechen population of about 1 million is mostly made up of Sunni Muslims, who maintain a distinctly different cultural and linguistic identity from Russian Orthodox Christians. The conflict dates back some 20 years, with Chechens having laid claim to land in the Caucasus Mountains region. Thousands have been killed and 500,000 Chechen people have been displaced from the fighting. A Chechen rebel leader took the responsibility for the deadly bombings that rocked two subway stations in central Moscow in March 2010. Russian security forces killed 17 suspected militants in the southern Russian region of Ingushetia last month, after a January 24 airport suicide bombing in Moscow this year. In addition, Chechen rebels held 700 audience-members hostage in a Moscow theater in 2002. A Russian effort to free them resulted in the deaths of 120 hostages. Chechen rebels also were accused of downing two Russian airplanes in 2004. And they took over a school in Beslan in the North Ossetia region in 2004. When the siege ended, more than 330 people had died -- half of them children. In recent years, the insurgency has moved to the east and the west -- to the republics of Dagestan and Ingushetia, where rebels are fighting troops to destabilize the region.",

Jean-Michel Colo, who officiates near the south-western city of Bayonne has refused to wed Jean-Michel Martin and Guy Martineau-Espel. The couple are now suing the mayor for discrimination, claiming that Mr Colo is breaching the same-sex marriage law which came into force across France last month. Protest: There have been numerous protests in France both in favour and against gay marriage, including this stunt at the recent French Open Men's Final between  Rafael Nadal of Spain and compatriot David Ferrer . The dispute is now set to provide a . test case for the new marriage law which has proven divisive in France . and has already seen thousands take to the streets to . protest. Mr Colo, 60, has been mayor of the . small village of Arcangues, in the Pyrenees-Atlantiques department, for . the past three decades. He now risks five years in prison and a . fine of around \u00a364,000 for his refusal to officiate at the wedding of . Mr Martin and Mr Martineau-Espel, who are both in their 50s. Divisive: The new gay marriage law has proven divisive in France where there were protests including this demonstration in March through the streets of Paris. It has also been opposed by both the Catholic Church . 'For me, marriage is for a woman and . man to have children,' said Mr Colo. 'I am not discriminating as a . same-sex couple is sterile. It's a parody of equality, it's a big lie.' Mr Colo added that he would rather 'go . to the gallows' than back down on the vexed issue. He has argued there . is a 'conscience clause' in the new legislation which allows public . officials not to take part in gay marriages. But Isabelle Duguet, the couple's . lawyer, said she had filed a case against Mr Colo for discrimination and . for refusing to carry out his official duties. She said that both of her clients were . 'currently in an intolerable situation, which was particularly unjust, . degrading and discriminatory'. Issue of conscience: The Mayor of Arcangues near the French south western city of Bayonne (pictured0 said the new law allowed him to refuse to marry the gay couple as an issue of conscience . Mr Martineau Espel said he and his . boyfriend had lived in the village since 2003 and 'wanted to celebrate . our wedding in the home we are committed to' and where 'we have the . almost uncontested support of our neighbours.' French interior minister Manuel Valls . has also warned Mr Colo of 'significant punishments' saying that public . servants had a duty to obey the law. The gay marriage bill is viewed as a . centrepiece of the legislative programme of France's Socialist . government. It is more than a month since the act was passed in the .

Big softie: The TV mogul dotes on his two fur babies . They have run riot at Simon Cowell's multi-million dollar Hollywood home - and helped him prepare for impending fatherhood. And in a sign of just how spoilt cute Yorkshire terrier puppies Squiddly and Diddly are - they are being flown back to the UK for Christmas by security guard, MailOnline can reveal. While music mogul Cowell, 54, will leave for his annual Caribbean jaunt following the final of tonight's X Factor final, his pets will be flown in business class on an Air France flight to Paris. From there, they will either drive or travel on the Eurostar across the English Channel to Cowell's $14.4million London home, where they will stay for the holidays. Indeed, the dogs - brother and sister - will set up home at the exclusive London address and stay there until Cowell and his pregnant girlfriend Lauren Silverman arrive in the Spring. The couple will travel to London - along with their newborn son, due on February 28 - as Cowell - whose fortune is now estimated at $370million - will be filming Britain's Got Talent. A business class flight on Air France will cost around $10,000. And a source said; 'Squiddly and Diddly are very well looked after, to say the least. 'But they have to travel in business class as Simon and Lauren really don't want to put them in the hold.' Because dogs aren't allowed to travel in the cabin on a British carrier, Squiddly and Diddly will land in Paris before being taken to London. The source added: 'Squiddly and Diddly have been to the vet and had their shots. When they're in the UK, they'll get their UK passports which will make it easier for them to travel.' Cowell and Lauren adopted the dogs in October - and he says they are helping him \u2018road test\u2019 his \u00a322\u2009million Beverly Hills mansion before the arrival of their son, nicknamed Baby Simon. Home for the holidays: Simon Cowell's dogs Squiddly and Diddly are being flown back to Britain for Christmas - while their master is away in the Caribbean . Bumping along: Pregnant Lauren Silverman shows off her bump as she holds hands with Simon Cowell as they head to dinner at Sur in West Hollywood last week . Cradling the puppies in his arms, a . clearly smitten Cowell told the Mail on Sunday last month: \u2018I\u2019m . experimenting right now with Squiddly and Diddly. \u2018I . think dogs are good training for babies. They are still puppies and . they are falling in the swimming pool and getting lost in the house. \u2018This . is a bit of a road test for the real thing. Squiddly is the girl and . Diddly is the boy and they are very naughty but great fun. I would say . to anyone thinking about getting a dog \u2013 just do it. They bring so much . happiness into your life.\u2019 The Yorkies have free run of the house and spend most nights curled up at the foot of their master\u2019s king-sized bed. Cowell, . who once admitted he was \u2018fanatical\u2019 about everything in his house . being \u2018just so\u2019, has clearly relaxed his rules for the new additions to . his family. Where he goes, we go: Simon Cowell cuddles his new Yorkshire terrier puppies during a TV interview . Life is tweet: Cowell has been posting uncharacteristically soppy messages about the dogs, like the on above which contained a picture of Squiddly . Meanwhile, as the Mail revealed, Lauren, seven-months pregnant with Cowell's baby, will be spending Christmas with her son Adam, seven. But the couple will spend time together over Christmas period as she will be renting a villa in the Caribbean with her son - while Cowell will be cruising around Barbados on the Slipstream yacht with friends including ex Sinitta, for the festive season. When Adam - whom she considers her first priority - spends New Year with his father, New York property millionaire magnate Andrew Silverman, the 36-year-old brunette will join Cowell on board. Cowell\u2019s romance with Lauren is said to have developed during past Caribbean jaunts. Rex factor: Cowell seems to be enamoured with Squiddly, who is the female one of the puppies . Their flirtations became obvious to friends during Simon\u2019s Christmas break to Barbados in 2011, when Lauren and her husband were invited. Their divorce was made final earlier this month. They are now widely expected by friends to marry. Their baby boy will be born in New York, where Lauren's mother Carole Saland can travel in from her home in Florida. And so far, Cowell and Lauren have been practicing at parenthood with their dogs. In one . shot, Diddly is seen drinking water from a fine china cup and saucer . placed on a designer leather side table while Squiddly \u2013 who is . virtually identical to her brother except for an ear which flops over \u2013 . perches on a silk cushion on the custom-made sofa. Another picture shows the pair relaxing on top of Cowell\u2019s magnificent grand piano. A source said: \u2018Simon is devoted to the dogs. He adores them and they have the run of the place. 'Whenever they go missing they\u2019ve usually raced upstairs to find Simon. Normally there isn\u2019t a pillow out of place but he\u2019s relaxed the rules for the puppies. They are very much his babies but he\u2019s definitely the master. He went away recently and\u00a0 when he came back he had to have words with Diddly because he was strutting a little. \u2018There was a bit of a drama when one of them almost fell into the swimming pool the other day. Obviously the whole house will be properly child\u2013proofed before the baby arrives. But the dogs have been a wonderful addition to the household.\u00a0 Simon has a dog trainer but it\u2019s pretty obvious they are the ones training him now.\u2019 It is thought Cowell named the pooches after his favourite 1960s cartoon about a musical squid called Squiddly Diddly. But during an earlier season of the US X Factor, he referred to his fellow judges Nicole Scherzinger and Paula Abdul by the moniker, dismissing them with the words: \u2018I think the audience at home are going to disagree with Squiddly and Diddly here.\u2019 Dog house: The cute pooches seem to be enjoying life in the music mogul's \u00a322m Beverly Hills mansion, above .

They are being raised on organic canned dog-food, . which their master feeds them twice a day. He and Lauren walk them . together every evening. The puppies are house-trained and have had piles of dog toys lavished upon them, according to insiders. Cowell says he will set up a Twitter account for the Yorkies soon, and has already used his own account to post pictures of the dogs. One was labelled, \u2018Happiness is 2 puppies asleep\u2019, another shows a dozing Squiddly with her eyes rolling back with the caption \u2018Squiddly has gone mad\u2019 and in another she is lounging on his bed with her tongue poking out, with the message: \u2018Squiddly wants an ice cream.\u2019 Lap of luxury: Squiddly and Diddly relax on the pristine sofa at Simon Cowell's Beverly Hills home . The pups have already had a taste of the spotlight, appearing on TV\u00a0 in America as their owner filmed segments promoting the latest series of the American X Factor. Cowell has long been a dog-lover and has said: \u2018I\u2019m going to leave my money to charity, probably dogs and kids.

A Cleveland bus driver has been suspended after a horrifying video surfaced online showing him brutally punching an unruly female passenger aboard his vehicle. The footage, which was posted on WorldstarHipHop.com and on YouTube, shows the unidentified woman exchange a barrage of insults and obscenities with the driver.

Scroll down for video . Violent: Stills from footage reportedly taken aboard a Cleveland bus show the male driver punching an unruly female passenger under the chin with such force she is thrown backwards . The man, who reveals during his interaction with the woman that he is a grandfather, immediately pulls back his fist and smacks her under her chin with such a force that she falls backwards. He grabs the woman and her coat and throws them off the bus before she re-boards and begins scuffling with him.

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\nIn a knife fight of a congressional hearing, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen defended his agency, but he sparked an uproar from Republicans by admitting it destroyed a key hard drive wanted in an investigation, and he did not apologize for the data loss. \"I don't think an apology is owed, not a single email has been lost since the start of this investigation,\" Koskinen told a dais full of skeptical GOP members on Friday. He argued the IRS has done its best to find the emails that originally went missing in 2011. Those emails are central to an investigation of why the agency targeted tea party and other political groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status. The hearing by the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee focused on the week-old revelation from the IRS that a hard drive belonging to a former top agency official at the center of the congressional probe, Lois Lerner, crashed in 2011. Tens of thousands of her emails saved on it dating to 2009 were destroyed. Lerner and that time frame are critical in the investigation. The targeting issue has its roots in the 2010 rise of the tea party and the Supreme Court Citizen's United decision, which bolstered the ability of independent groups to engage in political activity. Lerner ran the division in charge of tax-exempt status and is the highest-ranking official directly connected to the targeting so far. She has since retired and refused to testify before Congress on the matter, citing her constitutional rights against having to do so. The House charged her with contempt of Congress for her refusal to speak. IRS pushes back . Koskinen told lawmakers on Friday that not only has the agency tried to retrieve the Lerner emails, but he also pushed back at Republican reports that emails of six other IRS employees, including a former chief of staff, are missing. \"It turns out ... that none  of (the chief of staff's) emails appear to be lost,\" Koskinen said, scolding the Republicans on the committee. \"Piecemealing out information about a possible problem simply results in press releases and angry letters to me.\" For their part, Republicans were blistering. They expressed frustration that has built up for the past week. \"The American people have no reason to trust the IRS ... on this issue,\" said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp. The Michigan Republican pressed Koskinen on whether his agency knows exactly where the destroyed hard drive ended up. He replied that he was not sure if there was a serial number attached to the hard drive and that it was destroyed three years ago. Republicans drilled down on when the IRS knew about the hard drive problems. Time line key . The time line from Koskinen was nuanced. He said the agency knew in February that there was some kind of problem with Lerner's hard drive, but that it took until late April or May to determine that the hard drive crash had erased data. Why didn't he tell Congress sooner? Koskinen responded that the agency was trying to retrieve as many lost emails as possible first but decided to notify lawmakers after receiving a letter from the Senate Finance Committee last Friday. The committee indicated that it had completed its investigation and was doing a final check to make sure the IRS had sent every available Lerner email. Koskinen also pointed out that emails about the Lerner hard drive crash had been included in large bundles of documents, tens of thousands at a time, that the agency sent to congressional committees last fall. \"We've provided the information,\" Koskinen began to say under questioning by Texas Republican Kevin Brady. \"You have not provided us the information!\" Brady blasted back. \"At this point why should anyone believe you? ... This is the most corrupt and deceitful IRS in the history!\" Not to be believed . The outcry continued, leading to one of the most contentious exchanges of the day. \"This is unbelievable!\" exclaimed a visibly irate Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. \"The apology should be to the American people. I don't believe it. That's your problem. No one believes you.\" Koskinen, whose tone was sharp and defensive at times, responded that he has had a long career in government. \"And that is the first time anybody has said they do not believe me,\" he said. \"I don't believe you,\" Ryan repeated. \"That's fine,\" Koskinen said. \"We can have a disagreement.\" Democrats defended the IRS as an agency overloaded with work and underfunded by Congress, and accused Republicans of turning the hearing into a political tribunal. \"Was (Lerner's) hard drive crash a conspiracy? No,\" said Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the panel.  \"The prevailing conspiracy in this matter is that of the Republican's desire to stir their base, tie the problem to the White House and keep up this drumbeat until the November election.\" At one point Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra of California  gave the IRS leader friendly advice to take a deep breath before speaking. What's up with the IRS emails? Key questions about the controversy .",

A teenage mother from Texas has been arrested for allegedly trying to suffocate her baby son twice while the child was being treated at a local hospital. Cynthia Kaye Wood, 19, from Galena Park, has been charged with attempted capital murder. According to court documents, Wood called 911 September 30 to report that her 4-month-old son stopped breathing, . The infant was taken to LBJ Hospital and was later transferred to Children\u2019s Memorial Hermann Hospital. On October 12, Ms Wood called a nurse saying that her son was struggling to draw a breath. Once the young mother was reassured that her son was fine, she retired to the couch in the room to watch Law & Order, according to ABC 13 Eyewitness News. The 19-year-old later told police that she was watching TV and eating M&Ms when she heard her son making gurgling and gasping noises. Wood said she pick up the boy and began hitting him on the back. A nurse said she came into Wood's room after the baby's vitals alarm went off and found the mother holding her son's limp body in her arms. The hospital staffer said Wood was the only person in the room at the time, and she did not raise the alarm about her son's medical emergency. The nurse went to work on the baby, performing CPR on him until he was resuscitated. Court records show that the 4-month-old experienced clinical death before being revived. According to  documents cited by\u00a0Houston Chronicle, surveillance cameras inside the hospital room captured Wood on two separate occasions by placing her hand over her son's mouth and pinching his nose shut as the little boy tried to fight back, kicking his legs furiously. Brush with death: The incidents took place at Children's Memorial Hermann hospital, where nurses were able to revive the little boy . In one instance, prosecutors said the 19-year-old stuck a pacifier in her son's mouth and then covered his face with a blanket.

A rise in sadistic murders and attacks on children accused of witchcraft by their families and loved-ones means police will now receive specialist training. The Met has admitted its officers are rarely able to spot the signs that a youngster is in danger despite dealing with 81 sorcery cases in the last decade. Its religious violence unit will now offer all staff training in a pilot scheme that could be rolled out across the country after a spate of high profile cases. Tragic victims: Innocent Kristy Bamu, 15, left, was killed by his sister and her lover because they believed he was a witch. While Victoria Climbi\u00e9, right, was tortured and starved by carers who said she was possessed . Last month a woman who tortured her teenage brother to death after accusing him of witchcraft was jailed for life. Magalie Bamu and her boyfriend Eric Bikubi inflicted more than 130 injuries on 15-year-old Kristy Bamu over the course of a horrific four-day attack in Newham, east London. While eight-year-old Victoria Climbi\u00e9 was . tortured and starved to death twelve years ago partly because the . people who should have cared for her believed she was possessed. Detective Superintendent Terry Sharpe, head of the Metropolitan Police's Religious Violence Unit, told the Independent: 'We're very well aware that usually the first person on scene is going to be the young cop with two or three years' service who probably has no understanding of this whatsoever. 'We're not na\u00efve enough to think this is just happening in London. It is happening in Birmingham, it's happening in Leeds, Manchester and other big cities across the country.' A new booklet is to be handed to all officers and new recruits will get extra training. The paperwork will spell out language they should listen for when they enter homes and how to judge whether any child is at risk. Jailed: Eric Bikubi, left, and his partner . Magalie Bamu, right, were both jailed for life for the horrific torture . of Magalie's brother Kristy, which led to his death . This summer the Government will also send out similar advice to GPs, hospitals and schools so they can better spot the signs. Witchcraft abuse and female genital . mutilation are most often carried out by the religious and superstitious . in Britain's immigrant communities. Killers Bamu and Bikubi, like many Congolese nationals, were obsessed with kindoki, or witchcraft. The couple accused innocent Kristy of . trying to bewitch a child in the family after he arrived from Paris for . Christmas 2010 with four of his siblings at their council flat. WARNING: Graphic images below . Violent evidence: Kristy Bamu suffered 130 injuries after being tortured for four days with weapons including broken ceramic floor tiles . Witchcraft: These weapons were found at the scene in what officers called an 'unprecedented scenario' The pair beat him with a metal weightlifting pole, a curtain rod and a wooden plank, knocked out his teeth with a hammer and smashed heavy floor tiles over his head. The torso of a Nigerian boy, named Adam by police, was previously found in the Thames after he was ritually sacrificed. Police believe he may have been killed by someone with a terminal illness who believed his murder would save them.

The move by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is intended to stop Islamic extremists from \u2018brainwashing\u2019 children. But it has led to a clash at the top of Government, with Home Secretary Theresa May lining up with Mrs Morgan against Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. Mrs Morgan drew up the proposals in the wake of the \u2018Trojan Horse\u2019 plot by radical Muslims to take over schools in Birmingham, which led to the Government rushing in new measures to compel schools to teach \u2018British values\u2019 of tolerance. Nicky Morgan, is said to have drawn up the new proposals in the wake of the Trojan Horse plot in Birmingham schools . However, The Mail on Sunday has learned that the plan has infuriated Mr Pickles, who has argued it \u2018violates religious freedom\u2019, and warned about the impact on Catholic and Jewish schools. The Education Secretary wants to amend the Religious Studies GCSE course, which stipulates that pupils should study one \u2018world religion\u2019 \u2013 usually restricted to their school\u2019s faith. Mrs Morgan wants students to learn about a minimum of two religions to ensure that Muslim pupils become aware of \u2018different perspectives\u2019. Mr Pickles \u2013 backed by the heads of the Catholic and Jewish faiths in the UK \u2013 has pointed out that the plan could also compel other faith schools to teach pupils about Islam. A Government source said: \u2018Eric has really gone off on one over this. Home Secretary Theresa May, left, is supporting the plans, while Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, is against . \u2018He thinks that it is just meddling, and it will have a knock-on effect on the freedom of Catholic and Jewish schools to restrict their teachings to just their faith and preserve their distinctive ethos. Theresa however has been fully supportive. She thinks the most important thing is to stop a new generation of Muslims from being lost to the extremists.\u2019 The Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis is expected to raise the proposal at a meeting with the Prime Minister later this month. The Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, the Most Rev Vincent Nichols, is also understood to have privately expressed his concerns over the reform, while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, is \u2018broadly supportive\u2019 of the move. Last night an ally of Mrs Morgan defended the plan as essential to stop the radicalisation of children. The source said: \u2018We saw in Birmingham the dangers of allowing schools to inculcate an intolerant and ultra-Conservative version of their faith in young and impressionable pupils. \u2018If they are obliged to learn about another religion \u2013 in an even-handed manner \u2013 it will help to stop them from being brainwashed.\u2019 The Chief Rabbi and the Archbishop of Westminster declined to comment last night.",

Two of TOWIE's hottest stars have taken to the kitchen in an attempt to impress mystery dates by cooking them dinner. Reality TV's Tom Pearce and James \u2018Diags\u2019 Bennewith grapple with knives and flip pans with ease in the footage,\u00a0getting hot and bothered as they cook up a storm. Messy attempt: Diags starts to layer his tortillas with the mince and vegetable mixture . Armed with a recipe for lamb keema tortilla stacks, the lads, who left The Only Way Is Essex last year, competed against each other to make the best version of the dish. In the video filmed for a campaign for LambSoc, the online community for English Beef and Lamb, 23-year-old Tom is clearly the more experienced chef of the two as his pal Diags seems to struggle with the simple task of dicing an onion. But both lads can't stop the tears streaming from their eyes as they take their knives to the allium. 'Hahaha, you're crying,' Diags, 23, cheekily points out as Tom's eyes start streaming. Diags and Tom filming TOWIE before their departure from the ITVBe programme last year . Cook-off: Tom Pearce (left) and James \u2018Diags\u2019 Bennewith (right) start by dicing onions for lamb tortilla stacks . Blinded by tears, the pair continue to gamely dice onion, chop chilli and peel garlic. A one point it looks as though Diags is in danger of losing a finger after a particularly risky knife move by Tom. 'What are you doing?' he exclaims as Tom narrowly misses his digits. 'My fingers are there mate.' The dynamic kitchen duo then gently fry the raw ingredients in the pan, with Tom tossing the cooked ingredients as Diags adds generous spoonfuls of cumin and garam masala to the mixture. 'Mate, that's too much', Tom reprimands but Diags insists that he's following the recipe to the letter. Adding lamb mince to the pan, the boys take it in turns to stir, mixing in fresh herbs and tomatoes to the mixture. 'Look how juicy it's got all of a sudden,' Tom says as he stirs the mixture in the pan. It's good,' he says, as he tastes the mixture while Diags complains that it could be too spicy. Chefs in the making: Tom tosses the raw ingredients in the frying pan as Diags watches . Diags and Tom dish up their respective tortilla stacks to their mystery dates . The competition kicks up a notch\u00a0when it's time to assemble the tortilla stacks. Tom's precise stacking skills come to the fore as he carefully spreads his keema on the tortilla before sprinkling on the cheese. 'Tortilla down,' he says, placing it on the baking tray. He then spreads the mince before laying another pancake on the top. 'The trick to this is not to put too much filling,' Diags advises as Tom carefully lays another pancake on his pile before starting the the process again. But he then proceeds to ignore his own advice and starts piling the mince onto his tortilla . Bits of meat spill out of the sides and he has to use his fingers to pat them back into their floury casing. 'You have to massage the meat like you massage a lady,' Tom says, as he shows off his perfect tortilla stack. When it comes to garnishes and decoration, Tom opts for peas while Diags places a whole de-seeded chilli on his stack. They then put their creation in the oven, just in the nick of time as the mystery girls arrive for dinner. Presenting their respective offerings to their dates, Tom's presentation gets the thumbs up from both women, with special mention given to the peas. 'The peas look great; they're a bit more creative,' they say. Tasting their dinner, the women, who seem visibly surprised give it thumbs up, praising the 'rustic' taste and look of the meal. Lamb tortilla stacks . To make the lamb keema . Ingredients: 450G lean lamb mince; two teaspoons sunflower or vegetable oil; one large onion, peeled and finely chopped; two garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped or crushed; one inch piece fresh root ginger, peeled and finely chopped; one or two 1-2 green chillies, deseeded (if preferred) and finely chopped; two teaspoons ground cumin; three tablespoons garam masala or medium curry powder; four medium tomatoes, chopped; one or two teaspoons white sugar; two tablespoons tomato pur\u00e9e; salt and freshly milled black pepper; 100g fresh or frozen peas; large handful freshly chopped coriander, to garnish . Method:\u00a0Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and cook the onion and garlic over a low heat for 10 minutes or until soft and lightly golden. Add the ginger, chillies, cumin and garam masala or curry powder. Cook over a moderate heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the lamb and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, then add the tomatoes, sugar, tomato pur\u00e9e and bring to the boil. Season, reduce the heat and gently simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a little water, if needed. 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time add the peas. To make the stacks . Ingredients: Four to six corn or flour tortillas;100g grated mild hard cheese such as cheddar . Method: Preheat the oven to Gas mark 6/200\u00b0C/400\u00b0F. Place a tortilla on a large non-stick baking tray and spoon over a portion of the mince mixture evenly and a handful of cheese. Repeat with the remaining ingredients finishing with the cheese. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the cheese melts. Cut into equal portions and serve with salad. Tip: If preferred scatter some baby spinach on top of each keema layer.",

PUBLISHED: . 09:35 EST, 26 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:36 EST, 26 February 2014 . DVDs, word cards and books will do little, if anything, to help teach a baby to read, according to a New York University study . DVDs, word cards and books will do little, if anything, to help teach a baby to read. This is according to a New York study which claims that products designed to create infant geniuses could be a giant scam. A seven month experiment with babies aged up to 18 months found reading and flashcards made no difference to the children, but had a massive effect on the parents. The grown-ups were convinced their children were learning to read, although there was no scientific evidence to show this was true, said the study. Researchers from New York University's School of Culture, Education and Human Development tested a range of available 'reading' products for babies. This included DVDs, books with flip pages and specially designed word and picture cards, with the intention of getting the children to read earlier. The research, reported in the Journal of Educational Psychology, took place over seven months with 117 babies aged nine to 18 months. The children were randomly given different products or no products at all. The grown-ups were convinced their children were learning to read, although there was no scientific evidence to show this was true, said the study . Those given the products were asked to use them daily and researchers paid the families regular visits to test the language development of the infants and to interview parents. The youngsters were also brought into the lab to be given reading tests while tracking their eye movements. These can show experts whether a child is actually reading and recognising words or simply looking at shapes on a page, for instance. \u2018While we cannot say with full assurance that infants at this age cannot learn printed words, our results make clear they did not learn printed words from the baby media product that was tested,\u2019 said professor Susan Neuman. \u2018It's clear that parents have great confidence in the impact of these products on their children. However, our study indicates this sentiment is misplaced.\u2019 A different study published earlier this month seems to contradict findings from New York University. The study found it reading your baby a bedtime story could yield benefits for years to come. Research shows that children who are spoken to a lot are faster at understanding words. This speedy processing helps them do better at school \u2013 and could even help them get a good job, have a happy marriage and keep on the right side of the law. Psychologist Anne Fernald said that the effects are so profound that talking to children should be treated as importantly as feeding them. And it is never too early to start. Dr Fernald of Stanford University in California said: \u2018If you want your kid to do well in school, talk to them as a baby. \u2018If you bring a child into the world, we take on the responsibility for feeding them, keeping them clean and keeping them safe. \u2018I think we now have enough scientific evidence to add something else to that list \u2013 and that is providing learning from infancy on. \u2018Long before your baby is speaking, it is absorbing information about language.\u2019",

The rather fearsome-looking Trudi Goetz said she wanted to speak with the talk show billionairess \u2018as soon as possible\u2019 and also revealed her petrified member of staff will not be sacked or punished. She said: \u2018I don't know why she talked of racism.\u00a0 I . am sorry, but perhaps she is being a little over-sensitive here.\u00a0 Maybe . she was somewhat offended because she was not immediately recognized in . the store.' It came as Oprah said she was 'sorry' a media frenzy emerged after saying she experienced racism during a trip to Switzerland. Scroll down for video . Loggerheads: Store owner Trudie Goertz insists her sales assistant did 'everything right' and was not 'racist' to Oprah (pictured on the red carpet last night in LA) when she asked to see the $38,000 bag at the Swiss store . 'I think that incident in Switzerland was just an incident in Switzerland. I'm really sorry that it got blown up. 'I purposefully did not mention the name of the store,' Winfrey said. 'I was just referencing it as an example of being in a place where people don't expect that you would be able to be there.\u2019 The firestorm blew up after Oprah - who is promoting a film - gave an interview with Entertainment Tonight, in which she recalled a clerk at an upscale Zurich boutique refusing to show her a handbag. Winfrey said she was told she could not afford the $38,000 tom Ford Jennifer tote and said it proved that \u2018racism is still an issue\u2019. Meanwhile, Frau Goertz said today: \u2018For God's sake, no! I do not judge people according to their skin color, nor according to their income. I treat everyone equally. And I also expect my employees to do the same.\u2019 MailOnline has learned that the saleslady in question is Italian, aged 37, and was not a full-time employee of the ritzy Trois Pommes shop in Zurich where the incident took place - but she was sent there from the sister-store in upscale St. Moritz to help out. Now it is unclear where she is as she lies low in fear of \u2018public hatred\u2019. Cutting: Goertz suggested that - unlike Oprah - in Europe famous people liked to be treated like ordinary citizens . Er, sorry: Oprah said lat night at the premiere of her new film The Butler, that she was 'sorry' she had ever brought up the bag incident . Goetz, who was ironically also a guest at the wedding of Tina Turner \u2013 the reason why Oprah was in the country, has been left to speak for her. \u2018It's absurd,\u2019 she said. \u2018Oprah came into the business, wanted to see the crocodile bag. She inquired about the price. When my saleswoman told her that it cost 35,000 francs and then offered to show her cheaper ones, she walked away. And in a possible slap to Oprah's diva tendencies, she added: \u2018That is something that international stars appreciate in our country - that you leave them in peace.\u2019 Ms. Goetz, who regularly features in the society pages of Swiss newspapers and magazines, said that there will be \u2018no repercussions\u2019 for her employee - an Italian woman who worked for five years in a boutique in Milan before joining her. She went on: \u2018She did everything right. I can't blame her. She has been working for five years with me and is an excellent seller.\u00a0 She usually works in St. Moritz where there is a MOST demanding clientele. Scene of the crime: The upmarket Trois Pommes store in Zurich where the incident took place . 'She is so very sensitive. I repeat once again; my saleslady only meant well because she wanted to show other bags to Oprah. To demonstrate the whole range is, for me, a perfect service. I find it regrettable that Oprah has come to this service from exactly the wrong way. \u2018I saw Oprah at Tina's wedding but I only knew her from TV.\u00a0 We didn`t speak, and now unfortunately since then, this is played out before the entire world. \u2018I hope the business will not suffer as a result of this.\u00a0 I hope I can speak with Oprah to resolve the situation personally, as quickly as possible.\u2019 Today, it seemed that Oprah \u2013 who earned $77m last year, according to Forbes, was desperately trying to take her foot out of the mess she\u2019d put it in. Last night, the star gave an interview on the red carpet of The Butler, in which she has a role. She said: 'I'm in a store and the person doesn't obviously know that I carry the black card and so they make an assessment based upon the way I look and who I am,' said Winfrey, who earned $77 million in the year ending in June, according to Forbes magazine. Wedding guests: Ironically, Frau Goertz and wonfrey were both at the Swiss wedding of Tina Turner to Erwin Back (pictured) 'I didn't have anything that said \"I have money\": I wasn't wearing a diamond stud. I didn't have a pocketbook. I didn't wear Louboutin shoes. I didn't have anything,' she said. 'You should be able to go in a store looking like whatever you look like and say \"I'd like to see this\". That didn't happen.' Swiss tourism officials and the boutique owner apologized for the incident last week, but Winfrey insists there's no need. 'It's not an indictment against the country or even that store,' she continued. 'It was just one person who didn't want to offer me the opportunity to see the bag. 'So no apologies necessary from the country of Switzerland. If somebody makes a mistake in the United States do we apologize in front of the whole country? No!' Ironically, Oprah also came under fire today from the Swiss animal rights group Four Paws (Vier Pfoten) which slammed her for wanting to buy a crocodile skin bag and called on Trois Pommes to withdraw the item from sale. \u2018We do not know if Ms. Winfrey actually wanted to buy the bag,\u2019 said\u00a0 Chantal H\u00e4berling, spokeswoman for the group. \u2018But she should know crocodiles suffer for the production of such items. \u2018The animals are kept in extremely small enclosures,' she said. 'To kill them the animals are beaten with a hammer on the head, and\u00a0 in some farms and it sometimes takes two hours before they are dead.\u2019 Oprah is an avowed animal rights spokeswoman.\u00a0 PETA,\u00a0 the world\u2019s largest animal rights group, named her \u201cperson of the year\u201d in 2008 after she spoke out against the wearing of fur.",

A Royal Navy submarine had its silent running breached today when the Military Wives Choir came on board to reunite one of the singers with her submariner husband. Eleven members of the choir, comprising wives and girlfriends of military personnel brought together by impresario Gareth Malone for the BBC2 series The Choir: Military Wives, went on board HMS Turbulent in Plymouth Sound before she arrived back at her home base of Devonport. It was an emotional reunion for choir member Victoria Forth, 28, whose husband Tim, also 28, has been away on the sub for five-and-a-half months since his last leave. Reunited at last! Choir member Victoria Forth and her husband Tim share a long-awaited kiss on board the sub . Making waves: The Military Wives' Choir takes HMS Turbulent by storm with a flawless rendition of their charity Christmas single Wherever You Are on board the submarine in Plymouth Sound yesterday . The choir's arrival on board was a surprise known only to a select few. Leading Engineering Technician (LET) Forth and his wife were reunited after the choir performed a pitch-perfect rendition of their Christmas charity single, Wherever You Are, in the cramped control room next to the periscope. The crew - and LET Forth - looked on in stunned amazement as they burst into song. Mrs Forth, after greeting him with tears and a hug, said having him home was better than getting the Christmas Number One - pipping X Factor winners Little Mix. Back in the UK: HMS Turbulent stopped temporarily at Plymouth Sound for the reunion before returning to her base in Devonport after 284 days on duty . 'But with a very, very close, almost equal second, the Christmas Number One,' she added. 'If we get the number one, it means we raise that much more for the Royal British Legion and SAAFA (Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Families Association). 'It will be a really magic Christmas this year.' The song is in prime position to be the Christmas Number One, according to bookmaker William Hill. The choir has been backed by figures such as Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans, who has been urging listeners to support the single, and last Sunday they performed on Strictly Come Dancing. All smiles: Members of the choir, who were brought together for the BBC2 series The Choir: Military Wives, enjoy a well-earned cup of tea after their performance . They have also been invited to meet Prime Minister David Cameron at Downing Street. Tomahawk-equipped submarine Turbulent has been away for 284 days, spending 190 of them submerged. The vessel was East of Suez for much of her deployment. Singer Nicky Kenyon, 36, whose husband Adrian serves with 29 Commando Royal Marines, said that she had left her husband to look after their children - and do all the Christmas shopping. 'He said: \"You support me when I go away (on active service) for six months, the least I can do is support you when you do this\",' she said. There will be no problem with the Christmas dinner, as Mr Kenyon is a master chef with the commando unit, based in North Devon.",

The Czech was a surprise winner at SW19, beating Maria Sharapova in the final of the grass court grand slam, helping her to earn a place in the elite eight-strong field in Turkey. She faces experienced Russian Vera Zvonerava in the first match in Red Group and knows that to progress from the robin stage will be tough. \"It doesn't matter who's in the group. All eight players are very strong,\" she told the WTA official website. Kvitova, with four other titles in her breakthrough season, must emerge in the top two out of section which also includes World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki and Agnieszka Radwanska. Pole Radwanska is also a newcomer to the WTA Championships after a storming late season run with two titles. Arguably, she is in better form than her opponent Wozniacki in the second match on court Tuesday. While she was winning titles in Beijing and Tokyo, Danish ace Wozniacki was making early exits. \"I was the last one to get in here so I'm just going to enjoy myself and try to play my best tennis, like in Asia,\" said Radwanska, who had to sweat on the performance of first alternate Marion Bartoli in the final counting event at the Kremlin Cup before sealing her place. The final match of the first day's proceedings pits Sharapova against newly-crowned U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur in the Blue Group. Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and China's Li Na complete the section and will be in action Wednesday. Stosur, who stunned Serena Williams to claim her first grand slam title at Flushing Meadows, knows she faces a tough task to progress. \"Maria (Sharapova) and Victoria (Azarenka) I've never beaten before, so there's a great challenge in itself,\" she said.

Arrested: Police said that 29-year-old Jason Armstrong told them he was ordered by the Black Guerrilla Family, a violent prison gang, to smuggle a loaded gun into a city police station . 'An organized gang in the city of Baltimore sent an armed suspect into our building to see our security, to test our security,' Batts said at a press conference filmed by WMAR.

'I'm not going to sit on my heels and wait for it to happen again,' Batts said. 'We will move forward and hold those people responsible for sending him into that police station. We will hold them accountable.' WMAR reported that BGF was behind a scheme to sell drugs from Baltimore Detention Center, and that both employees at the facility and BGF members have been indicted. Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez also spoke at the press conference, and said of Armstrong 'He did not go in there on his free will. This person had very little option, according to his statement.' 'We have verified as much as we can now his affiliation and his prior contacts with the police,' Rodriguez also said. 'We know of incidents that took place before that caused him to be in this situation.' Officers said late Tuesday that Armstrong had been charged with weapons and narcotics offenses. The FBI issued a memo last month warning of potential threats against police officers nationwide. The incident also comes less than a month after the December 20 slayings of NYPD Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu by Issmaiyl Brinsley, who earlier wrote online he was 'putting wings on pigs.'

It was reported yesterday that a complaint about the 1930s painting - by RH Westwater - had been logged by Police Scotland as a \u2018hate incident\u2019. The mural, which was painted in 1936 by RH Westwater and features scenes from Alice in Wonderland across nine panels, features a golliwog . Visiting parent Margaret Rocha, 43, who is herself black, made an official complaint after touring Wardie Primary School in north Edinburgh with her son who was at that time a prospective pupil. The image is contained in a mural, based on Alice in Wonderland, which was lovingly restored two years ago and now takes pride of place in the school\u2019s assembly hall. Last night Henry Westwater, 74, of Tain, Inverness-shire, said golliwogs had once been common, though he could understand why the image had proved offensive. But he suggested treating the situation as a \u2018hate incident\u2019 may be a flawed approach and said that while he would not want part of the mural to be \u2018hacked out\u2019, he could understand why some would want the golliwog image to be removed. Mr Westwater said: \u2018It was painted in 1936, when people\u2019s perception of things was somewhat different. \u2018I remember that I had a golliwog when I was a small boy; many children did. They used to be popular.\u00a0 For this woman, her response to that image was obviously compelling and overwhelming. \u2018I saw photographs of the mural when it was restored, and I dug out my copy of Alice in Wonderland. \u2018My neighbour, for some reason, had collected 12 copies of Alice in Wonderland in different editions, and of course there was no golliwog in any of them. Council bosses have resisted pressure to remove or cover up the artwork at the school in the north of the city - but have introduced extra anti-racism lessons . \u2018It may be he felt the fantasy element of the story gave him some licence to create a new character.\u2018But my father didn\u2019t have any views at all on other races, and he was certainly no racist.\u2019 He added: \u2018I can see why it could be a bit offensive \u2013 I didn\u2019t give our children or grandchildren golliwogs. \u2018This woman has every right to complain.\u00a0 But this painting is from another time. \u2018I would not wish to criticise the police, as I understand the legislation is framed in such a way that they are obliged to investigate complaints and I wouldn\u2019t want to presume to lecture the council\u2019s education department. \u2018But for a \u201chate incident\u201d, there has to be a \u201chater\u201d - and that seems to be something missing from this case - while the artist [who died in 1962] is long-dead.\u2019 Scottish artist Robert Heriot Westwater, who painted a mural depicting Alice In Wonderland at Wardie Primary School in Edinburgh in the 1930s . He added: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t like the mural to have a bit of it hacked out, but if someone feels strongly enough that it should be painted out, and replaced with something else, that would be okay.\u2019 Fife-born Robert Heriot Westwater, who was born in 1905, was responsible for well-known portraits of poet Hugh MacDiarmid and Sir Compton Mackenzie, who wrote the comic novel Whisky Galore, later turned into a hit Ealing comedy movie. Last night Police Scotland said Mrs Rocha\u2019s complaint was still being considered. Mrs Rocha was astonished to find the mural, which features scenes from Alice in Wonderland across nine panels. It was restored in 2011 with a \u00a317,600 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). Mrs Rocha, who said she would now find a different school for her son, said she found the image \u2018deeply offensive\u2019 and struggled to believe the recent restoration had been be allowed. She said: \u2018I raised it with the headteacher and she shrugged her shoulders and didn\u2019t seem to think it was an issue. \u2018It\u2019s an inappropriate image for a primary school hall. It\u2019s one thing if it was a museum piece or an exhibition, where you might explain what a swastika was or Ku Klux Klan outfit. \u2018It goes back to the American Black Sambo - the blacked-up face.\u2019 In the mural, the golliwog is sitting on an alcove ledge above the Alice in Wonderland figure in the mural\u2019s central panel. The mural and Wardie school\u2019s distinctive architecture are well-known in academic circles. Colin McLean, head of HLF Scotland, has contacted the school over the future of the artwork, with further discussions likely to take place later this week. Last night the City of Edinburgh Council reiterated its position \u2013 that it will not consider covering up the image. But officials have said they will now use additional teaching packs from Show Racism the Red Card campaign at the school. A council spokesman insisted the council and school took diversity and anti-racism extremely seriously.",

I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules and regulations,\" said Lerner at the hearing. She has since been placed on administrative leave. But that statement angered Republican House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and others on the committee, causing him Thursday to threaten to recall Lerner and force her to answer his questions, believing she had, in fact, waived her constitutional rights. What it means to take 'The Fifth' \"She just testified. She just waived her Fifth Amendment right to privilege,\" South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, said to applause during Wednesday's hearing. \"You don't get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination. That's not the way it works.\" Issa agreed. \"After consulting with counsel, Chairman Issa has concluded that Ms. Lerner's Fifth Amendment assertion is no longer valid. She remains under subpoena, the Committee is looking at recalling her for testimony,\" Oversight committee spokeswoman Becca Glover Watkins told CNN Thursday in a statement. Issa's office declined to explain what his counsel's legal basis was for deciding that her Fifth Amendment assertion is no longer valid. But Democrats and several legal experts think Issa was wrong. \"I'm surprised that chairman Issa's taken that position,\" Ranking House Oversight Committee Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland told CNN on Thursday. \"First, all the law that I've read says that she did not waive her right. As a lawyer I don't believe she waived her right. And I believe that we as a committee should honor one's right, and as a matter of fact.\" Some legal experts agree. \"The only true ways to \"lose\" one's rights under the Fifth Amendment are, one, for a court to find that the claimant does not have a reasonable fear of prosecution, because nothing she says could in fact become a helpful link to a prosecution, or two, to get an order of immunity that guarantees that nothing she says will in fact be used to prosecute her,\" said Miguel A. Estrada, a conservative attorney who helps head the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher's appellate and constitutional group and who was once nominated by President George W. Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals. \"The first is unlikely here, and no one is offering to do the second.\" It is true that high-profile congressional hearings are equal parts official proceeding and political spectacle. And the very act of being called to testify before Congress can create an impression of guilt in the court of public opinion, even though the congressional panel isn't issuing any kind of legal ruling. In these instances, it might be best to show up with an attorney for the benefit of appearances for the folks back at home watching on television, but plead the \"Fifth\" on sticky legal questions. But even in front of Congress, experts say, a witness doesn't necessarily lose Fifth Amendment protections by speaking first. \"One can invoke the Fifth Amendment at any time. Giving a preamble or any kind of statement doesn't void that,\" said Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, an associate professor who teaches constitutional law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \"Now does it look suspicious? Yes. Does it undermine the person's credibility? Yes.\" Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, former lobbyist Jack Abramoff, retired Lt. Col. Oliver North, baseball player Mark McGwire and White House party crashers Tareq and Michaele Salahi all invoked Fifth Amendment privilege before Congress due to concerns that anything they may have said could have been used against them in court. And, like Lerner, many of them offered some type of statement before or after taking The Fifth. \"I think what she did was unconventional,\" said Samidh Guha, a former federal prosecutor who now practices at the law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP. \"But it's hyper technical to say she waived her Fifth Amendment privilege.\" CNN's Dana Bash and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.",

But you wouldn't think it watching this video. In a bizarre clip that is both heart-warming and strange, five grey wolves kiss and cuddle a photographer - who is happy to join the pile of love. Scroll down for video . Warm embrace: Photographer Monty Sloan kisses a giant grey wolf as he rolls around on the floor . The pack at Indiana's Wolf Park abandon their predatory reputation in favour of a cuddle with the willing man . The pack starts by circling each other and wild life photographer Monty Sloan on a lake-side green at the Wolf Park in Battle Ground, Indiana. Mr Sloan is poised to take a picture but it seems he cannot resist returning the sharp-fanged animals' affection. Alarmingly, in the Park's description . of the pack, they explain that they are 'very friendly' to their prey - . but sources insist this was a moment of genuine affection. 'Wolves . do not growl or snarl at their prey,' the guide explains, 'It would be . like a human getting angry at an ice cream cone he or she was about to . eat!

Affectionate: Standing on the lake-side green, he ruffles their furry coats as they get more excitable . Still snapping: Inching back, Mr Sloan tries to capture the moment at Wolf Park in Battle Ground, Indiana . But the group catches him as he walks round and they tumble to the floor, licking and cuddling each other . And the doting photographer grapples to cling on to his long lens camera whilst cuddling the friendly greys . According to DNA studies, the domestic dog and the grey wolf is almost identical. But their marginally different brain development speed is the thing that sets them apart. Wolves . start to mature about two weeks earlier than their notoriously friendly . cousins - meaning they are quick to judge and make enemies. As a result, they are far from ideal pets. Domestic dogs are said to originate from wolf cubs that were used as guards by humans over 40,000 years ago in southeast Asia. Since that time wolves have been domesticated and used have been used by humans for hunting and herding. There are around 400 modern breeds of domesticated dogs. But tumbling around on the floor, these animals show no sign of cunning. They climb on each other to lick his face and nuzzle his head. Incredibly, the fearless animal lover kisses them back. Eventually the group roll onto the floor, where the snuggling continues. Mr Sloan juggles the excitable hounds with his camera as he flounders underneath the doting pile. The scenes completely contradict normal behaviour for the carnivorous breed, which feeds off mammals. Unlike their cousins - dogs - these animals are instinctively wild, with a strict code of conduct based on hierarchy within their pack. There is one line of rank for males and one for females. The alpha male and female lead their packs. Second in command is the beta male or female. At the bottom is the omega wolf - a scapegoat. Although there are leaders and weaklings, it is not always survival of the fittest. It is always the hungriest that gets to eat first, not necessarily the biggest. Working together, they ensure each member has a role to play and none are neglected. Contrary to popular belief, wild wolves are not dangerous. Naturally afraid of humans, they scarper in an instant, making them 'safe'. However, domesticated wolves and hybrid breeds are notoriously violent as they have lost their fear.",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\n(CNN) -- It's safe to assume that most people outside West Africa had never even heard of Mali until a few weeks ago. If they had, there's a good chance it was thanks to some beautifully flowing song or instrumental by one of the country's many world-renowned musicians: Salif Keita, Tinariwen, Oumou Sangare, Toumani Diabate, Rokia Traore... the list is long. If it wasn't music then it might have been Mali's priceless medieval manuscripts that drew their attention, or its majestic mud-built mosques, its filmmakers, poets, photographers and writers. Like Jamaica or Ireland, Mali's music and culture are its primary asset, its shop-window to the world, its \"gold and cotton\" as one famous musician put it. Certainly, very few people would have included the words \"Mali\" and \"Islamism\" in the same sentence before April last year, when Islamist militia took control of over two thirds of the country and started amputating the hands of thieves, stoning adulterers and whipping women who happened to venture out into the streets 'improperly' dressed. With the arrival of French forces and the mass hostage seizure at the Algerian oil facility of In Amenas, Mali and Islamism are two words that now appear not only to be inextricably linked but on the front page. Six reasons why Mali matters . Of course, the association goes back much further than April 2012. Al Qaeda and the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) moved south from Algeria and into Mali's remote northern deserts over a decade ago. It proceeded to amass a fortune from kidnapping, smuggling and money laundering whilst undermining the local economy, disrupting social relations and destroying the local tourist industry. It brought along a hardcore form of Islam inspired by Wahabism and a hatred of the West that was previously almost unheard of in Mali, a country which has long contented itself with gentler and more tolerant brands of Sufism richly tinted by local pre-Islamic beliefs. AQIM also managed to hijack a rebellion against the central government in Bamako by the nomadic Touareg people of the north that had been grinding on and off for the best part of fifty years. This conflict, which first erupted in 1963, was always about power, influence and the self-determination of a marginalized people. It was also about preserving the Touareg's unique Berber culture. It had never been about imposing hard line Islam on anyone. But from round 2006 onwards, Touareg nationalism and Islamic terrorism became inextricably confused with each other. Why Africa backs French in Mali . Indeed, there's a widespread theory, confirmed by the word of just a few bit-players in the drama but lacking any more conclusive evidence, that certain parties who were utterly averse to the idea of an independent Touareg state -- the Malian government, Algeria and others -- either deliberately implanted AQIM in the region, or at the very least tolerated its presence there. It was hoped that the strategy would attract military aid and doom the Touareg nationalist project to failure. The theory might seem strange given the damage that terrorism has wrought in both Mali and Algeria but most Touareg I know accept it as gospel. We'll probably never know the whole truth. What's certain is that the Sahara is one of the hardest places on earth for an outsider to understand. Its interlocking cogs of power and influence -- geopolitical, regional, governmental, tribal, mineral, criminal, spiritual, clan and family -- are fiendishly complex. No foreign intervention can hope to achieve any long-term benefits if it cannot get to grips with the underlying political and social mechanism of this vast region. 2011 brought the Arab Spring and the end of Muammar Gadhafi, who had long been a stabilizing force in the Sahel, and both a promoter and a hinderer of Touareg nationalist ambitious. His weapons arsenals were opened up to armed groups of every stripe and in January 2012, the Touareg used this opportunity to reignite their rebellion in northern Mali. But it was al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb who eventually took control, either directly or through a network of alliances. Now Mali's hopes lie with the French, who intervened on Friday January 11, after months of diplomatic wrangling at the U.N. and elsewhere. France 'not a pacifist nation' So the world has a new front on the global war on terror and France has a new battle to fight in Africa. Within northern Mali itself, however, and throughout the Muslim world, this is not seen as a war on terror but as a cultural conflict, one that pits a group of people who feel that the future of their society will be best served by rejecting Western liberal values and returning to the core tenets of Islam against another group who believe in religious tolerance, secularism, democracy and music. This conflict turns musicians, artists and writers into frontline soldiers. Saudi Arabia destroyed its mausoleums and silenced its musicians decades, even centuries, ago. In the Algerian civil war of the 1990s, many musicians, writers and cultural figures were killed, prompting others to flee overseas. In Mali they're still singing, still writing, still fighting, for the time being at least. In this new battleground in the cultural wars of the Muslim world, a distant mirror of the religious wars that shook Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, Malian musicians are taking a stand. That's why music matters. That's why Mali matters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andy Morgan.",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a middle school student:\n\nA couple of years ago, I stepped off a plane at a small airport in a far corner of the planet, and caught a taxi into town. You do not really notice Ushuaia as you enter it \u2013 because, despite marketing itself as the world\u2019s most southerly city, there is not a great deal of it. But what you do spot, about halfway through the cab ride, is the memorial to the Argentinian dead of the Falklands War, placed very prominently at the roadside. Indeed, you cannot miss it. This stark slab of iron \u2013 from which the outline of the Falklands archipelago (or Las Malvinas, as the Argentinians prefer to call it) has been cut \u2013 could scarcely be described as pretty. But it makes a firm point: What happened in 1982 has not been forgotten here. Under fire: The Top Gear team - with Jeremy Clarkson centre of image, seated - while filming in Argentina . My mind has drifted back to that memorial over the last couple of days, as the furore over the actions of the Top Gear team, and its star Jeremy Clarkson, has gathered momentum. For those of you who have missed this \u2018event\u2019 (perhaps you have better things to do with your life, or perhaps you prefer some news with your news stories), Clarkson has been accused of angering the locals in southernmost Argentina by driving around in a Porsche whose number plate apparently references the Falklands War. The plate in question reads \u2018H982 FKL\u2019. A line of numbers and letters which has been taken by the Argentinian media to refer to the year of the conflict, 1982 \u2013 and the islands over which it was fought. Cue unpleasant scenes in Ushuaia, this outpost at the foot of South America \u2013 with various reports of vehicles being pelted with stones, the Top Gear presenters being pursued to the Chilean border by a mob, and police assistance required to get them out of the country. Cause of controversy: Clarkson's 1991 Porsche, with the number plate that has been seen as a war reference . After the event: The same Porsche is seen with damage to its windscreen after an encounter with a local mob . All very unsavoury, then, with Top Gear cast, again, in an unpleasant light, and Ushuaia \u2013 an important tourist destination \u2013 doing its image a considerable disservice. The city is the key point of access for the spectacular islands of Tierra del Fuego \u2013 the fractured lower tip of South America \u2013 as well as voyages that venture to Antarctica. But as with a juvenile spat in 2012, where two British ships were refused harbour in a show of lingering bad feeling, Ushuaia is once more in focus for reasons other than its glorious scenery. Naturally, Top Gear has issued the requisite denials. The number plate was a coincidence, we have been told \u2013 a work of total chance. The 1991 Porsche came with the plate when it was bought by the show back in August \u2013 acquired specifically for the 1350-mile drive through Argentina which has been filmed for the programme\u2019s 2014 Christmas special. Make of that what you will, although bear in mind that Clarkson has a record of trying to offend his hosts when filming Top Gear in overseas locations \u2013 in 2012, he prompted complaints from the Indian High Commission after driving in India with a lavatory strapped to the back of his fast Jaguar, in a glib pot-shot at the country\u2019s sanitation issues. Doomed: The sinking of the General Belgrano in 1982 was the most controversial moment in the Falklands War . Not forgotten: The General Belgrano sailed from Ushuaia in April 1982 - and its sinking is still keenly felt there . Perhaps the producers are telling the truth. Perhaps serendipity has frowned upon Top Gear, handing it the equivalent of a Countdown Conundrum that it could not solve. But what should be very clear is that if this was a deliberate stunt, pulled by the makers of the show in a gesture of boys\u2019-club humour, then it was both crass and insensitive. Thirty-two years after its outbreak, the Falklands War is still a notoriously thorny issue between Britain and Argentina \u2013 and it remains a highly troublesome topic in Ushuaia. The losses of the war are still keenly felt in the city because the conflict\u2019s most difficult moment \u2013 the sinking of the Argentine warship General Belgrano \u2013 had its roots here. The naval cruiser set sail from Ushuaia on 26 April 1982. Six days later, it was sunk by the British nuclear submarine HMS Conqueror, with the deaths of 323 men on board. Site of remembrance: Ushuaia has a very visible memorial to the Argentinian dead of the Falklands War . Very much an emotive issue: The war is still a big topic in a city that played a direct role in the events of 1982 . The incident has helped to keep the fires of the Falklands debate aflame ever since. Notoriously, the General Belgrano\u00a0was outside the 200-mile exclusion zone around the archipelago that had been declared by Britain as a theatre of definite conflict \u2013 and was sailing west, away from the Falklands, and back towards the Argentinian mainland. Some naval officials in Argentina \u2013 including H\u00e9ctor Bonzo, the doomed vessel\u2019s captain \u2013 have described the sinking as a legitimate military act, revealing that the ship was mid-manoeuvre, and ready to attack. Others, including some here in Britain, have called it a war crime. The rights and wrongs of the assault on the Belgrano are never likely to be resolved into one smooth narrative. But you do not need a degree in military history to understand that the subject is still emotive in a city that waved farewell to the dead men. Nor do you need a Masters in geography to appreciate that people are still upset in a place that sits just 400 miles from the Falklands (a hop and skip in a region of long distances and empty horizons). And you do not need to be an apologist for Argentina\u2019s aggression and invasion of the Falklands in 1982 to realise that people mourn their loved ones who do not return home. Missing the point: Jeremy Clarkson's latest Twitter defence fails to understand why people might be upset . Argentina lost 649 soldiers in the conflict. Half of them passed through Ushuaia en route to a watery grave. In other words, it is not a city where you make jokes about the war. It is certainly not a place where you make references that treat the drowning of so many sailors as if it were the result of a football match. Or that most noxious of terms, \u2018banter\u2019. Perhaps, as has been said, the number plate was an accident. But Clarkson\u2019s responses to the matter show he hasn\u2019t grasped why this has caused outrage. He has said via Twitter: \u2018These war veterans we upset. Mostly they were in the 20s. Do the maths.\u2019 Thus utterly missing the point. Does he think that only soldiers who have seen service are affected by war? That their families and children just shrug and carry on with their lives, oblivious? No doubt the Top Gear team will repeat the coincidence claim until the story has faded into the background. No doubt the Christmas special will be an enormous success, its viewing figures boosted by the controversy. No doubt it will go on to sell a huge number of DVDs, and add to the reputed \u00a3150 million the show makes for the BBC every year. At the end of the world: Undeniably pretty, Ushuaia can lay claim to being the most southerly city on the planet . In happier moments: Normally, Ushuaia is a tourism destination where cruises for Antarctica start and finish . If so, perhaps I could suggest a few more unforeseen coincidences of which the show could be an entirely blameless and wholly unfortunate victim in future episodes. What about a dash around northern France in cars that \u2013 good lord, who could ever have made the connection? \u2013 accidentally refer to the 19,240 British men who were slaughtered on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in July 1916? How about a quick jaunt to the beach at Dunkirk with a number plate that \u2013 oh dear, if only we\u2019d spotted it in time \u2013 casually mentions the 11,000 Allied soldiers killed in the evacuation of 1940? What wit. What chutzpah. What bravado. Oh my aching sides.",

World class: More than $300,000 of world-class wine stolen from the famed Napa Valley, California, restaurant has been found in a private cellar in North Carolina a month after the theft on Christmas night . No arrests have been made. Officials from the Greensboro Police Department were not immediately available for comment on Friday. An online wine list shows the bottles sell for $3,250 to $7,950 at the restaurant. Screaming Eagle wines, one of the most highly sought-after American wines, were also stolen. On Monday, after a nearly monthlong investigation, analysis of forensic evidence, and numerous interviews, Napa County Sheriff's detectives traveled to Greensboro to recover the majority of the wines stolen from the restaurant. The investigation is ongoing. The sheriff's office will be working with state and federal law enforcement authorities to following up on leads developed in case, Pike said. He declined further comment. Mystery: Detectives said they currently have no idea how the haul was transported 3,000 miles to Greensboro . The theft occurred on Christmas evening or night at Chef Thomas Keller's famed restaurant, which is known for twice daily serving nine-course tasting menus, none of which uses the same ingredient more than once. In 2003 and 2004, the French Laundry was named best restaurant in the world by Restaurant Magazine. The restaurant had closed one day earlier for a six-month kitchen remodel.",

Speaking of freshness, Jimmy Iovine showed up. They'd found him living in the boiler room under Joe Pesci's School of Speech (the Harvard of the West; sorry, Stansbury) and he was more than happy to come sit in a little room off to the side and drop little truth pellets all over the Top 24. I've missed him and the way my stupid Text Edit program auto-corrects his name to \"iodine.\" Jimmy gave more frank and succinct criticism of the kiddies over a few minutes of edited commentary than the judges have doled out all season. On DeAndre: \"What he needs is a coach.\" On Reed Grimm: \"Way too kitschy for me, way too cabaret. Not gonna make it on this show like that.\" Eben Franckewitz: \"Not ready for primetime.\" Baylie Brown: \"Beautiful tune, nice tone, but she lost the plot.\" And my favorite, Jimmy on Adam Brock: \"Supposedly he has a large black woman trapped in his body. As of right now, he's not pulling them both off.\" Someone had to say it. Jimmy only lost me a little when he compared Aaron Marcellus to a cheesy Don Cheadle and called Heejun Han's intentions into question. Just because the kid has a sense of humor doesn't mean he thinks the show is named \"American Comedian.\" Everyone knows it's named \"American Adele.\" Heejun wouldn't be in the Top 13 if he couldn't actually get through to people while the music's on. So here they are -- your Top 13! America's Top 10: Phillip Phillips, Jessica Sanchez, Hollie Cavanagh, Joshua Ledet, Heejun Han, Shannon Magrane, Skylar Laine, Elise Testone, Colton Dixon, Jermaine Jones . Wild cards: Erika Van Pelt (Randy's choice), Jeremy Rosado (J. Lo's hugmonster), and DeAndre Brackensick (Steven Tyler's 17-year-old spirit animal) The six wild card contestants had to \"sing for their lives\" while their nine devastated compadres had to sit around, playing dead. Up first: Jen Hirsh on the Beatles' \"Oh Darling.\" Maybe they showed too much of her too soon. I'd been really excited about Jen heading into this week, but the magic was gone. I agreed with Jimmy that Jen should have stayed miles away from Adele on Wednesday and this last performance of hers seemed just as desperate in terms of what he called \"vocal pyrotechnics.\" She changed much more of both melodies than she needed to. It's always a fine line on Idol -- wanting to make something your own vs. going too far. I realize that Jeremy Rosado was a mostly personal/emotional choice for J. Lo, but I ain't mad at her because I love watching people cry, and because his high notes on Carrie Underwood's \"I Know You Won't\" sounded perfect to me even through the tears. If Jeremy is as popular with the other singers as he seems, I think he's a good one to have around during these first few weeks. It's always better when the cast can be at ease with each other -- and have you heard Jer-Bear gives the BEST hugs? \"Something's going through your body right now,\" suggested Ryan as Jeremy shook with emotion after his performance. If this was Ryan's way of begging for a hug, he should consider being more direct. Just get in there. Nestle, quick! Not so tender was Brielle Von Hugel, who nearly knocked Ryan over in her excitement to be called back into the spotlight, which is where Brielle belongs. \"That's just Brielle,\" she said OF HERSELF. \"Putting a twist on old classics.\" Right, Brielle? Right. Brielle. Anyway, moments after Jimmy Iovine had bitched about there being \"too many Adele wannabes,\" Brielle launched right into Adele's \"Someone Like You.\" [Aside:] I tend to have no shame regarding the way I live, and have generally adopted a \"sucks to be you\" attitude toward my neighbors when it comes to my TV habits. I'm sorry the apartment walls are thin, but we're all paying rent here and I'm just trying to do my job, you know? In all my years of recapping embarrassing reality television, Brielle's performance marks one of the few times I've ever actually turned my television way, way, way down -- not, like, as a courtesy to the Thai delivery guy (that's normal) but as a way to save face from strangers passing in the night. I could hear that someone was about to walk by outside, and I suddenly couldn't bear the thought of him or her thinking I might have CHOSEN to listen to \"Someone Like You\"...like this. [/End of aside.] . Against all odds, the blessed Steven Tyler was honest with Brielle. \"I heard you nail it. A little pitchy in some spots in the turnaround. I just didn't hear it this time, I'm sorry baby.\" It took him three sentences to twist his gist from lie to truth, but he did it. I'm proud of him. You could tell DeAndre Brackensick was a shoo-in for the wild card before he'd even begun \"Georgia On My Mind\" -- pretty much because of his hair. You just cannot NOT put that hair in the Top 13 when the hair-owner in question also has this super-high, very pure voice which, as of yet, he has no idea how to handle. The vocal coaches will help him, and he'll either figure it out in the near future or he'll crash and burn like the fire Eben Franckewitz never quite set to the rain. DeAndre is an adorable, sweaty, unpredictable sweetheart and I love not knowing what crazy hairography or misguided vocal gymnastics he'll try to pull off next. I'm into it. Yes! After getting sacked with having to sing second of 12 girls Wednesday night, Erika Van Pelt got her second chance and went all out in her purple bridesmaid shift on Lady Gaga's \"Edge of Glory.\" She kicked ass. In fact, I'd comment on this performance the same way as Jimmy Iovine commented on her showing from Wednesday: \"She has music in her blood, and great restraint -- something the show needs more of, not less.\" Erika didn't need to twist this song into a wretched balloon animal of Lady Gaga in order to prove she was the one to bring in as a finalist. Singing it solidly was enough. I'm not sure it'll be enough to keep her in much longer; I'm just glad we'll get to hear her voice another time. She does need a big performance next week -- and better placement. Finally, the judges called for Reed Grimm. Do it, Reed! Sing Adele's \"Hometown Glory\" the way it was meant to be self-indulgently cackled and scatted! No, Mr. Grimm gave Adele (and Randy, whose favorite word is \"Adele\") a break by self-indulgently cackling and scatting his way through Bill Withers' \"Use Me.\" Eliminated: Reed Grimm, Brielle Von Hugel, Jen Hirsh, Chase Likens, Hallie Day, Adam Brock, Baylie Brown, Chelsea Sorrell, Creighton Fraker, Aaron Marcellus, Eben Franckewitz, Haley Johnsen . I'm fairly happy about this Top 13. I'm extremely happy about a Fox press release I just received that informs me that Deandre Brackensick \"makes Polynesian costumes for a living\" and that Hollie Cavanagh \"loves old couples.\" Who doesn't?! I'm making a Polynesian costume right now! (In Photoshop; you can't see it until it's perfect.) Also, Jessica Sanchez \"can rap,\" y'all. Watch out. Next week the girls will don all-new pageant gowns to sing Whitney Houston, while the guys will try out Stevie Wonder. I wonder....if DeAndre can just make his hair look even prettier than usual and get permission to sing \"How Will I Know (If Heejun Really Loves Me).\" Fingers crossed!

A gel that was found to reduce the rate of HIV infection among monkeys when administered after sex could possibly work on humans too, researchers have found. Scientists have found that monkeys can be protected against HIV infection with a vaginal gel, even when it is administered three hours after sex. The research, which was published in Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday, tested a\u00a0 new microbicidal vaginal gel on macaque monkeys. Macaque monkeys were treated with the new gel and five out of the six monkeys were protected from infection . 12 monkeys were given vaginal washes of simian HIV to mimic sex with an infected monkey. Three hours later, six of these monkeys were treated with the newly-developed gel and the other six were given a placebo gel. Of the six macaques given the new gel, only one was infected with HIV, compared to all six of the monkeys who were treated with the placebo. If the gel works in humans, it could represent a breakthrough for preventing HIV infection, particularly for women who have been raped. Sharon L. Hillier, a professor of obstetrics at the University of Pittsburgh, told the New York Times that if the gel worked in humans, \u2018it could be used for HIV prevention like Plan B or the morning-after pill for contraception\u2019. The gel contains raltegravri, antiretroviral drug already in use for HIV treatment, and some HIV-prevention gels do exist, but they usually require a pre-exposure dose. Success in monkeys does not always predict success among humans, and testing such drugs on humans is complicated and raises serious ethical considerations. However, the results are encouraging and add to a sense of optimism in the field of HIV research. Two separate trials last week showed that monkeys who received injections of slow-release HIV drugs were protected from infection for weeks. In other research, two babies in the U.S. who were born infected with HIV appear to have been cured by large doses of drugs administered soon after birth. The study adds to other encouraging findings in the field of AIDS research in the last few weeks .",

It couldbe the year for discovering notorious monarchs. Just weeks after remains found under a car park were confirmed as Richard III, archaeologists now believe they may just have stumbled on Alfred the Great. Amid great secrecy, a team exhumed an unmarked grave at a more fitting location for a Royal burial - a churchyard in Winchester named in ancient documents as his burial place. After a delicate 10-hour operation on Monday, human skeletal remains were unearthed in the churchyard of St Bartholomew\u2019s in the Hyde area of the city, and taken for storage at an undisclosed location. Unearthing Alfred the Great, the Anglo-Saxon king who fought off the Vikings and established the foundations of our law codes and justice system, would be one of the most significant finds ever. Historians agree that the king, who died in the year 899 after a distinguished 28-year reign, had a great impact on Britain today, safeguarding the English language and Christian religion. But archaelogists admit discovering him would be a very long shot, as unlike Richard III who remained under the same car park for five hundred years, Alfred\u2019s bones were moved at least twice. Earlier this year, Katie Tucker, an archaeologist from the University of Winchester leading the search admitted it would be difficult to prove any remains are his - but hoped her team could prove the age of the bones. She said: \u2018If the bones are from around the 10th century then that is proof they are Alfred and his family, because Hyde Abbey was not built until the 12th Century, and there is no reason for any other bones from the 10th Century to be there.\u2019 No-one from the university would comment on the latest developments last night, as the exhumation was carried out behind metal screens on Monday and yesterday in total secrecy for security reasons - although filmed by a TV company. It is not known how Alfred the Great died, but he was buried in the Old Minster, the Anglo-Saxon cathedral in Winchester. Archaeologists carried out the exhumation of an unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's Church in Winchester, Hampshire (pictured), this morning on church orders . Alfred lived from 849 AD to 899 and was born in Wantage, Oxfordshire. He is the only English monarch to be afforded the title The Great . Alfred is the only English monarch to be known as 'the Great' and was the first to consider himself King of the Anglo-Saxons. Although he is often portrayed as a great warrior in statues around Winchester and Wantage, he was not physically strong and is believed to have suffered poro health for most of his life. One of the legends surrounding the king was that, while fleeing from Danish aggressors, he hid in the home of a woman who did not recognise him. She asked him to look over her cakes that were baking in the oven but, troubled by his kingdom's problems, he absent-mindedly allowed them to burn. Alfred was born in 849 and died on October 26, 899. He had been King of Wessex from 871 until his death. It is not known how he died. He was originally buried temporarily in the Old Minster in Winchester, then moved to the New Minster. In 1110 Alfred's body was transferred to Hyde Abbey. Soon after the dissolution of the abbey in 1539, during the reign of Henry VIII, the church was demolished, but the graves were left intact. The royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed on the site. No confirmed remains of Alfred have subsequently been found. When Alfred\u2019s son King Edward the Elder built an impressive New Minster two years later - possibly to house his father\u2019s body - the remains were moved there. Then, in the year 1110, old chronicles reveal the monks at New Minster moved to new location nearby and took the bones with them again, to Hyde Abbey, a little north of the city, along with the remains of King Alfred the Great\u2019s wife and children. This Abbey was demolished when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in 1539 although most of the graves were left intact. The site was looted by convicts in the 1700s and there seem to have been some attempts to dig for Alfred there in the nineteeth century with no success. Permission to dig at the churchyard was granted by the Diocese of Winchester for security reasons following recent publicity about King Alfred - to prevent people attempting to dig him up. A spokesperson for the Diocese confirmed human remains were exhumed, and that the rector of St Bartholomew\u2019s and the Bishop of Basingstoke performed prayers at the graveside beforehand. No application has yet been made to carry out scientific testing on them, but the diocese expect this will be received very soon. Dr Helen Foxhall Forbes, a lecturer in early medieval history at Exeter University who is not involved in the dig, told the Mail last night: \u2018Even if they do radio-carbon dating on the bones which reveals they are from the tenth century, we do not know if it is Alfred. \u2018The monks may not have moved the correct bones or made sure they weren\u2019t contamined with any other remains. \u2018With Richard III, not only did he have distinguishing features, his scoliosis, to identify him, but they were able to find a surviving descendant after 500 years to do DNA testing. With a king who died more than a thousand years ago that would be very, very difficult. \u2018The DNA testing on Richard III was done by experts wearing forensic suits, as even breathing on the remains can contaminate it, so I would be concerned about the amount of tampering with the bones over the centuries. As a historian I would love it if they found him but it would be an extremely long shot, I would be very dubious if they said they had found Alfred the Great.\u2019",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\n(CNN) -- The headlines seem like something from the past: Congressional hearings are held to debate women's access to contraceptives. A talk show host uses a derogatory and misogynist term to describe a graduate student seeking access to contraception on her campus. And for-profit employers are suing the government to avoid providing coverage for contraception within their employees' insurance plans on the basis of their personal beliefs. But this is no flashback: These conversations about contraception are happening now, in the present day, with outdated views and inaccurate information playing a leading role. As physicians dedicated to improving the health of women, we ask: Why is contraception still seen as controversial in the face of overwhelming evidence about its benefits? Why is birth control questioned, in this day and age, despite its widespread acceptance and use? In the current debate, science and facts are being drowned out by highly vocal and misinformed voices; as physicians, we must set the record straight. In the case that comes before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, owners of the craft store chain Hobby Lobby and furniture makers Conestoga Wood will argue against a provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires insurance coverage of all FDA-approved contraceptive methods within employer-sponsored health insurance plans. In enacting this provision, the government agreed with America's medical professionals: Birth control is essential health care that must be covered like any other preventive service. Opinion: Corporations playing religion card over birth control . Let us make clear that we respect the rights of others to have their own personal beliefs. However, in exercising these beliefs, the owners of Hobby Lobby are denying scientific fact and asking to restrict employees' access to important preventive care. For example, one of the debates with the Supreme Court case centers around the employers' opinion on how contraception works: The employers think that certain forms of contraception (emergency contraception pills and intrauterine devices) cause abortions. But what they believe about science is contradicted by the science itself. Emergency contraception pills work by inhibiting or postponing ovulation, or the release of the egg, and this prevents fertilization from occurring. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) work by preventing sperm from reaching the egg, either by creating a barrier or by creating an environment that inhibits the mobility and viability of sperm or, in the case of copper IUDs, potentially by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg before a woman is pregnant. None of these contraceptives causes abortion. Already, contraceptive care is essential preventive care for millions of women. The ability to time and space children reduces fetal, infant and maternal morbidity and mortality. Contraception can help families better plan for pregnancies, leading to more optimal health outcomes. Planned pregnancies lower the risk of potentially serious issues such as low birth weight, preterm birth and small-for-gestational age. They also prevent an unanticipated worsening of health for women with pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease. Of course, contraception reduces unintended pregnancy. There is a reason why, in a recent poll, a majority of Americans favored coverage of contraceptives: It is because we need look no further than our own homes to see the value of contraception. The typical American woman will have two children in her lifetime. That means she will spend more than three decades trying to avoid pregnancy. Virtually all American women who are or have been sexually active have used contraceptives at some point during their lives. The value to women's lives and families is clear. But for a woman to make the best decision about the birth control that is right for her, coverage of all FDA-approved contraceptives is necessary. Cost of contraceptive care can be a major factor that determines not only which method a woman uses but whether she is able to use birth control at all. This is especially true for low-income and hourly workers. Birth control is often an additional health expense that many women simply cannot afford if money is tight, putting them at high risk for an unintended pregnancy. We see this problem frequently when we counsel our patients about the most effective contraceptives, namely IUDs and implants. These methods are up to 20 times more effective than the birth control pill in preventing pregnancy, and they are often the safest options for our patients. But high up-front costs put these methods out of reach for a lot of women. Insurance coverage for contraception without a co-pay would allow a woman to choose the best method for her, not just what fits in her budget. Taking away coverage would effectively block access to those most-effective methods. Birth control is not only safe and effective preventive care, it is also care that physicians support and millions of women need. Allowing an employer's personal values to trump his or her employees' right to care would allow the beliefs of the few to trump the health of many. That's both bad policy and bad medicine. As physicians committed to the health care and well-being of women, we urge the Supreme Court to consider the crucial individual and public health issues at stake when they weigh their decision in this important case. The health of millions of women and their children hangs in the balance. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Jeanne A. Conry and Dr. Nancy L. Stanwood.",

He told me yesterday to look after the horses and not go in the trechens (sic) so was not in the thick of it but I wish I had been with him all the same. Poor Mr Wroughton.' An old photograph of Lt Wroughton's grave. Private Haselin, who wrote the letter, had been in service at Lt Wroughton's parent's country estate . The heroic officer aged 11. He was the son of an English aristocrat and the world's first Boy Scout . After his master\u2019s death, Pvt Haselin wrote again: 'I always ride his charger and look after it so you see I still serve him in a way, never a day passes but what his name is not mentioned as being so good to us all.' One of the other archived letters was . from Robert Baden-Powell who seven years earlier, when he founded the . Scout movement, selected their 15-year-old son for the first camp on . Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset. The pair later travelled to America to give talks on the Scouts before the outbreak of the First World War. Baden-Powell . wrote: 'I have felt as nearly as possible like a second father to him . and to read the little testimonies to Bob\u2019s character...is the greatest . possible comfort. 'I am so glad he had made his mark already before he died. That must be some comfort to you and to his mother.' Another letter was from Lt Wroughton\u2019s sergeant major who enclosed a photograph of his grave at Ypres with it. Sgt . Maj Lockyer wrote: 'He was such a brave young officer. Sgt Stone & I . carried him to a place of cover, his last words to me were \u2018never mind . me Sgt Major, look after yourself.' The archive, that also includes Lt Wroughton\u2019s identity tags, is now being sold at auction with a pre-sale estimate of \u00a31,000. Richard . Westwood-Brookes, of auctioneers Mullocks of Shropshire, said: 'What . comes out of these letters is how this young man was a hero. 'He thought more of his servant and his horse than he did for his own safety. 'The . spirit of comradeship and self-sacrifice is the philosophy of the Scout . movement and clearly Baden-Powell instilled that belief in Bob . Wroughton. 'His story is . similar to that of Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey, who went to the . Western Front with his footman who ends up getting killed. Lt Wroughton aged 8-years-old.

Because there's no insurance paperwork, Dr. Lorna Stuart says she has more time to spend talking with patients. \"The day-to-day time that I spent on paperwork was increasing, while my patients weren't getting the good care that I wanted to give them -- face-to-face time, one-on-one time,\" she recalls. \"I vowed to do whatever little I could about this inequity of care.\" For Stuart, that vow came in the form of opening her own clinic and treating the uninsured. \"Every single person knows somebody without health insurance,\" says Stuart. \"There are so many people that fall through the cracks.\" According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 47 million Americans are currently without medical coverage. So Stuart set out to alleviate that problem where she could -- in her old steel town of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. She confided her desire to start a clinic in the Rev. Marie Swayze, her friend whose parish property was home to a Victorian-style rectory that had become dilapidated from disuse. The two concocted a plan to restore and remodel the mansion into a place that anyone would be happy to visit for quality medical care. Then, leaving private practice, Stuart sold her house and set out to raise $400,000 in donated funds, materials and services. In 2002, these efforts resulted in \"The Clinic: Medical Center for the Uninsured,\" a charitable, sun-filled clinic that has since received more than 40,000 patient visits. Individuals receive free or low-cost primary medical care across eight specialties, regardless of income or locality.  Watch Stuart explain how her healthcare dream came true \u00bb . \"Since there's no need to spend a lot of time doing paperwork, we have time to talk to the patient and really hear what they're saying,\" says Stuart. \"So the patients go away feeling they've been heard, that they've been helped.\" An arsenal of more than 100 local volunteers, including 20 retired and practicing physicians, assist Stuart in providing expert medical services to more than 800 patients per month from across the southeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware area. She even invested in Spanish language audiotape lessons to better communicate with her Spanish-speaking clients. Patients are informed that each visit costs about $60, but they are only expected to contribute what they can toward their care.  Watch Stuart explain the benefits of visiting \"The Clinic\" \u00bb . \"Many patients pay as little as a dollar or even 50 cents for the same dignified care that patients contributing in full receive,\" says Mary Ellen Smith, The Clinic's medical resource coordinator. Patient contributions account for 20 percent of The Clinic's $900,000 annual operating budget. The rest comes exclusively from private grants and donations. If The Clinic accepted money made available through government aid programs, they would be significantly restricted in terms of whom they would be allowed to treat, and how. For Stuart, giving good old-fashioned care again has restored her sense of fulfillment.  Watch Stuart explain how her clinic provides care to the uninsured \u00bb . \"Each day, I get to treat the patients whom our medical system has forgotten, without the hassle of insurance paperwork,\" says Stuart. \"Is it any wonder I once again feel the real joy of practicing the craft that I love?\" E-mail to a friend .",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\n(CNN) -- I was sitting in a wheelchair in an elevator of a hospital when the aide pushing me lay a binder on my lap. My medical record! It was heavy, hundreds of pages charting all I had endured since a runaway truck in Jerusalem broke my neck months before on May 16, 1990. I knew that medical charts were off-limits to patients. But I was 19 and hemiplegic (the left half of me paralyzed) and curious. And so, I opened it with my one good hand and read what a droll psychologist at Mount Sinai had somehow gleaned from our occasional games of chess: \"Joshua appears compliant and motivated and expressed good insight into the nature and course of his disability.\" I closed the binder quickly, my mind at ease. Patients no longer have to resort to stolen glances. Ever since 1996, when Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, all of us (save a small number of people with severe mental health disorders) have had the right to read our records. But only a tiny percentage of patients do -- \"at most, 1 percent,\" says Tom Delbanco, a professor at Harvard Medical School who has long called for hospitals to offer patients easy and full access to their records. That patients ignore their medical records is understandable. Records are largely dry data: test results, medications, vital signs, physical examinations. But ultimately, they are accounts of lives and deaths. And when I recently read my own record -- a thousand-odd pages written over four months in three hospitals in two languages -- I learned a lot, felt in the know. Prager: Is our suffering God's will? That feeling of empowerment, it turns out, is typical. Starting in 2010, Delbanco and Jan Walker, a researcher at Harvard Medical School with a background in nursing, surveyed 20,000 patients at three hospitals who were invited by e-mail to read the notes their doctors had written of them. Great majorities of the patients who then read their records felt more in control of their care (81%) and were better at taking their medicines (69%) too. All but 1% wanted to continue to read their records. Doctors, meantime, were by and large reluctant participants in the study only to then concede that their worries had been unfounded. (\"My fears: Longer notes, more questions, and messages from patients,\" wrote one doctor. \"In reality, it was not a big deal.\") Not one of the 105 doctors in the study chose to stop inviting patients to read their notes. A second study published two months ago and conducted by Dr. Susan Woods, an internist at the Portland VA Medical Center, also concluded that transparency greatly benefits patients. (This study did not assess its effect on doctors.) And so, 17 years after HIPAA, its ramifications are finally being understood. Perhaps it is no surprise then that more hospitals are reaching out to patients. In the last year, the Veterans Health Administration and the Mayo Clinic began programs that grant patients easy and full access to their records online, the records just a click away for more than a million patients. And as more patients read their records, a second revolution in medical records may very well begin: caregivers writing them in collaboration with their patients. Here's why: In recent years, hospitals have digitized patient records. This has prompted many doctors to cut and paste text from one section of a medical record to another which in turn has led to billing abuses and also to the replication of mistakes. And so Delbanco and Woods predict that as more patients read their records online, they will begin to monitor and share them and, eventually, amend and comment upon them too -- much as the public does an entry on Wikipedia. This amended record will not simply be more accurate; it will be truer -- and truer and truer the more caregiver and patient collaborate. Doctors will no doubt shudder at the thought of collaborative records. But so did those doctors surveyed about granting patients access to their records only to then find that transparency bred trust, not lawsuits or even extra work. All agree that the goal of medical records is to improve patient care. And so, the question is simple: Would allowing patients to comment upon their own records improve their care? Well, how could it not? If doctors consult the ancient histories of patients to know them better, how could written responses from patients about their care, in real time, not be as valuable? Back in 1990, I would have loved to collaborate with my caretakers, to comment daily upon dosages and treatments and them too -- my saintly nurses Mary and Patrice, my patient doctors Frank and Tom, my skilled and kind therapists Katie and Beth. And, yes, there were a few horrible white coats to write of too who made us blue gowns pay for the audacity of independence and disagreement and minirebellion. Would my words have made a difference? I don't know. But now that access is here, collaboration is coming. It will arrive much sooner, patients, if you read your records. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joshua Prager.",
        "output": "Joshua Prager: Reading my medical record, I learned a lot about myself .\nHe says all patients have the right to examine their records but only tiny minority do so .\nStudies find that access to records helps patients and improves care .\nLetting patients contribute to the records is the next logical step, Prager says ."

The judge said there's no need to restrict her movements because she's not showing symptoms of Ebola. In his ruling, LaVerdiere thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and wrote that 'people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational'. It was also claimed today, the 33-year-old nurse's roommate in Sierra Leone had been treated for Ebola but the court reportedly said that any risk had passed. Scroll down for video . Kaci Hickox and her boyfriend Ted Wilbur spoke to the media today outside their home in Fort Kent, Maine after a judge ruled there was no need for her to restrict her movements . Fox\u00a0reported the detail on Miss Hickox's roommate following the court ruling. According to the affidavit, a CDC official in Maine said: 'The Respondent's roommate in Africa became infected without knowing how she became infected with Ebola.' At a press conference outside her home on Friday, Miss Hickox said the information that her roommate had Ebola was inaccurate but did not offer any more details. She said: 'I am humbled today by the judge's decision and even more humbled fro the support we have received. 'I know that Ebola is a scary disease. I have seen it face to face and I know that we are nowhere near winning this fight. She continued: 'To my fellow healthcare workers in West Africa, both national and international staff risking their lives to fight this disease my thoughts, prayers and gratitude remain with you. As a global community we can end Ebola.' She told reporters that at the moment she had no plans to go into Fort Kent because she did not want to make anyone uncomfortable. She said: 'I'm going to have Ted make my favorite Japanese meal and watch a scary movie since it is Halloween.' Maine Governor Paul LePage disagreed with the judge's decision, but said the state will follow the law. 'As governor, I have done everything I can to protect the health and safety of Mainers. The judge has eased restrictions with this ruling and I believe it is unfortunate. However, the State will abide by law,' LePage said.

The state went to court Thursday to impose restrictions on Hickox until the 21-day incubation period for Ebola ends on November 10. Hickox, who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, contended confinement at her home in northern Maine violated her rights. The judge thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and acknowledged the gravity of restricting someone's constitutional rights without solid science to back it up. 'The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,' he wrote. 'The court is fully aware that people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational.' Hickox, 33, stepped into the media glare when she returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone to become subject to a mandatory quarantine in New Jersey. After being released from a hospital there, she returned to this small town, where she was placed under what Maine authorities called a voluntary quarantine.

Hickox remains at risk of being infected with Ebola until the end of a 21-day incubation period, Dr. Sheila Pinette. 'It is my opinion that the respondent should be subjected to an appropriate public health order for mandatory direct active monitoring and restrictions on movement as soon as possible and until the end of the incubation period ... to protect the public health and safety,' she wrote.

Jackson \"wrongfully refused to pay or account for such profits,\" the suit, filed against the singer and Optimum Productions, says. The suit characterizes Optimum as \"a defunct corporation\" Jackson has used as an alter ego. The suit accuses Jackson of \"concealing the extent of net profits\" by not giving an annual accounting for at least the past four years, and maintains that Jackson is \"guilty of fraudulent, malicious and oppressive conduct.\" Jackson's lawyers have not responded to the suit, which was filed on January 21. The video was based on Jackson's 1982 album by the same name, one of the top-selling of all time. Landis, best known as director of \"Animal House\" and \"An American Werewolf in London,\" made the song into a short horror movie, complete with Vincent Price adding narration. Word of the suit comes just after an announcement that Jackson has signed a deal to take the dancing zombie story to the Broadway stage.

Supermodel Linda Evangelista and the billionaire father of her five-year-old son have settled their bitter child support battle - over the phone. The surprise settlement, revealed by a source to The New York Post, comes three days into the court scrap that revealed some of the uglier truths about the former couple's four-month relationship. In the first two days on the witness stand, Francois-Henri Pinault, who is now married to actress Salma Hayek, revealed he broke up with Evangelista when he discovered she was pregnant. Settled: Supermodel Linda Evangelista, pictured arriving at court on Monday, has made a surprise child support settlement with Francois-Henri Pinault, the father of her son . And Evangelista's lawyer also claimed the . Frenchman, who is heir to a staggering $11.5 billion family estate, had . demanded the supermodel have an abortion as he did not want the child. It . is not clear whether Evangelista has won the $46,000 a month she . expected Pinault to pay for their son, with the source only claiming he . had 'gone a  long way toward meeting those original demands'. The . exact settlement was not disclosed by the source, but it comes just . before Evangelista was due to take the witness stand, potentially . offering further insight into Pinault's reluctance to raise a child. The . legal teams will appear in the Manhattan family court at 2pm today . to announce the settlement. It is believed they will have to return to . court on Tuesday to confirm the details in writing. Shake-up: The agreement comes as Evangelista was due to testify against Pinault on Monday . The court battle, which began last Thursday, has focused on the care of five-year-old Augie, who was conceived during his parents short-lived relationship in 2005 and 2006. His supermodel mother had said the boy's care - including around-the-clock nannies and armed drivers - cost her $46,000 a month, and she wanted Pinault to cover the hefty bills. Evangelista's . lawyer William Beslow had also argued that Augie deserves a lifestyle . similar to that of Pinault's four-year-old daughter with Hayek, born just months after Augie. Pinault, 49, is heir to a family estate estimated at $11.5billion. As chief executive of . PPR, . the conglomerate that owns Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Bottega Veneta, he earns $5million a year. He . spends $50,000 a month just on the taxes, upkeep and loan payments for . the $12million Los Angeles home he's put in trust for the girl, . Valentina, the Post reported. And taking the witness stand, he . revealed he spent a staggering $260,000 on gifts for himself in 2010 - . but could not remember what he had bought his son or how much he had . spent on him. Escape: It is not known if Pinault, seen Monday, will pay the $46,000 a month Evangelista demanded . Bitter feud: The former couple were expected to spend four days in court to thrash out a settlement . 'I have a watch collection,' he said, the New York Post reported. 'It's for when I buy a watch for me.' He . went on: 'I bought him a present for his birthday and for Christmas,' yet admitted he could not remember what he bought Augie for his fourth birthday. And for Christmas: 'I bought it online. It was a piano thing.' Despite his wealth, Pinault had criticised Evangelista for . her outlandish demands, suggesting the $46,000 a month is in fact for 'mom . support'. She has maintained she is modelling or working on her image at . all hours of the day. 'Most of the expenses do not relate . to Augie but they relate to Ms. Evangelista,' Pinault's lawyer, David . Aronson, said in opening statements on Thursday. 'It is the classic case of someone trying to bootstrap herself to something that is alimony.' Support: Ahead of the settlement on Monday, Evangelista was pictured with her son Augie and ex-boyfriend Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Peter Morton, from whom she broke up last year . Revelations: Evangelista's lawyer claimed Pinault asked her to abort the baby. Augie is now five . Also at the trial on Thursday, Evangelista's lawyer recounted a conversation the former couple shared in January 2006. 'After some initial happiness, he told her he wished she would terminate the pregnancy,' Beslow told a support magistrate. Evangelista, . who was then in her early 40s, told Pinault she would keep the baby. Pinault revealed the couple had spent just seven days together in four . months when she made the announcement. Ready to party: Linda Evangelista appeared at . the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Ball the same night as she was thought . to have settled her alimony suit against her former boyfriend . Francois-Henri Pinault . 'She would support the child herself, since he had made it perfectly clear to her that he had no interest in doing so. And she did.' Pinault said he found out she was pregnant . in early 2006 and admitted he broke up with her on hearing the news. 'She was so happy to be pregnant,' he said. 'But it was not planned. I decided to stop the relationship at that point.' He added: 'We were dating four months and I didn't even know her very much.' Asked . why he didn\u2019t pay Evangelista anything in child support for the first . years of Augie's life, Pinault answered: 'She didn\u2019t ask and I didn\u2019t . offer.' Unhappy ending: Evangelista was excited about her pregnancy, while Pinault was not, he said in court . Fears: At the child support trial, Francois-Henri Pinault (left) also revealed his wife actress . Salma Hayek (pictured) feared their daughter Valentina (right) might . have Down's syndrome . It also emerged on Friday that he had . asked his former girlfriend to delay the process of legally recognising . Augie as his son as his wife Hayek was going through a difficult . pregnancy. 'We were told the baby had Down . syndrome until late May 2007,' Pinault said, adding that Hayek, then 41, . almost lost their daughter Valentina. Evangelista agreed to delay the process and he was grateful, the New York Post reported. Although she was accused of piggybacking on Pinault's lifestyle, Evanglista's lawyer said she was 'looking for a continuation of the . reasonable lifestyle of Augie'. 'I need to protect him,' Evangelista told Love magazine in February. Last year a judge questioned the model's need for full-time nannies, asking how often she worked. 'When I work, it can be a 16-hour . day,' she said. 'On days when I do not work, I am . working on my image. I have to hit the gym. I have beauty appointments. I . have to work toward my next job and maintaining my image, just like an . athlete.' Demands: Evangelista is not so hard up herself, earning millions from high-profile modelling campaigns, cosmetic contracts and cover shoots . Last week, Manhattan divorce lawyer Raoul Felder . said the eye-watering payout - which comes to $1,500 a day - was unlikely. He pointed out that judges . consider how much it costs to care for a child, rather than the wealth . of the parents. 'She\u2019s in for a big surprise. I wouldn\u2019t be counting the money yet,' he told the New York Daily News. Evangeista is worth $8million and owns a . penthouse in Chelsea, New York and an apartment near her . son\u2019s school on the Upper East Side. She . broke up with billionaire and Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Peter Morton . last year and filed her case against Pinault shortly after the break up. Since, Pinault has been paying child support - although the amount has not been disclosed. The couple dated from . September 2005 until January 2006, and she was pregnant with Augie when . Pinault began dating Hayek in April 2006. He and Hayek married in 2009. Evangelista had kept the name of Augie's father secret until it was written in court papers filed in August.",

Sony's highly-anticipated PlayStation 4 finally launches in the UK on Friday, with stores across the country opening at midnight tomorrow. Yet keen gamers have already started queuing outside the PS4 lounge in Covent Garden, London to make sure they don't miss out and some have been queuing since Monday. Armed with blankets, sleeping bags and tents, PlayStation superfans are bedding down to spend the the next 24 hours in almost freezing temperatures to be first in line. Computer game fans queuing outside the PS4 lounge in Covent Garden, London for a chance to buy a PlayStation 4. First in the queue was Imran Chowdri (pictured), from East Croydon . Sony's PlayStation 4 has been praised for being cheaper than Microsoft's Xbox One console - the PS4 goes on sale for \u00a3349 in the UK and $399 in the U.S, while the Xbox One costs \u00a3429 and $499. However, Sony is selling its console at a loss according to figures from analytics firm IHS. The Colorado-based company found that the bill of materials (BOM) for the PS4 equates to $372, plus manufacturing costs taking it up $381. This is $18 less than the retail price. Although Microsoft saw similar queues ahead of its Xbox One launch last week, even the most die-hard fans didn't arrive until around 7am on the morning of the launch. The PS4 Lounge in Covent Garden opened two weeks ago to coincide with the console going on sale in the U.S. It was opened so fans could play PS4 games ahead of their official release Friday. Prices for the PS4 start at \u00a3349 - around \u00a380 cheaper than the Xbox One, but some retailers have already sold out of pre-orders and others are warning they may not get new stock in time for Christmas. Asda announced today it has got extra stocks of the console and 155 stores will be selling the machines from midnight Thursday. The PS4's launch line-up features 22 games including military shooters, sports simulations and family-friendly adventures. It also offers media apps, including Hulu and Netflix, with the aim of enticing non-gamers to splash out on the console.

The slimline machine has a new user interface that lets gamers connect with other users and download games and films from the PlayStation Store. Sony says the console has ten times the processing power of the PS3 and offers a screen resolution of up to 1080p. It claims the console's faster frame rates will mean environments in games, TV shows and films will be more detailed, lighting will look more realistic and animations will be smoother. Fans began queuing outside the PS4 Lounge in central London, pictured, on Monday . The PS4 Lounge in Covent Garden has been open since the U.S. launch to allow die-hard fans to try out games ahead of the UK release and will be the focus of the UK launch . However, only time will tell if the PlayStation 4 will be as big a hit as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One. More than one million Xbox One consoles were sold throughout the world in the first 24 hours, according to Microsoft, which surpasses first-day sales of the Xbox 360 - the previous-generation model. The new console was launched in 13 countries at midnight on 22 November and the software giant said it sold out almost immediately at most retailers.

It was the first major console release for the Japanese company since 2006. Analytic firm IHS predicted earlier this year that Sony's PlayStation 4 would outsell Microsoft's Xbox One and be the most popular console among gamers buy the end of next year. However, John Lewis disagrees and predicted last week that Microsoft's console will outsell Sony's despite being more expensive.

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a middle school student:\n\nJohannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Brazilian World Cup winner Bebeto believes his country's current crop of stars are capable of earning a record-extending sixth title in South Africa. The former striker, now 46, was a member of 1994 team that triumphed in the United States along with the likes of Romario and captain Dunga, who is now Brazil's national coach. He scored three goals in that tournament, and made the headlines after celebrating his effort in the quarterfinal against the Netherlands by racing to the touchline and rocking his arms back and forth in honor of the recent birth of his third child. That year Brazil became the first country to win the World Cup four times, having last triumphed in 1970. They managed it under the guidance of coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who is now in charge of 2010 hosts South Africa. Brazil won a dour final on penalties against Italy after the match ended 0-0 following extra-time, and Dunga has been criticized for instigating a similar tactical approach as he left out talented but faded stars such as Ronaldinho and Adriano from his 23-man World Cup squad. But Bebeto told CNN's Pedro Pinto that Dunga deserves to be given time to impress, having opened the event with a hard-fought 2-1 win over North Korea ahead of Sunday's second Group G clash with the Ivory Coast at Johannesburg's Soccer City. \"I think that this squad is a very strong one. There already world champions in it: Lucio, Juan, Kaka, and others that already won the cup,\" he said. \"Experience is important. Dunga is working with a group of winners: they came top of their qualifying group, they won the Confederations Cup here in South Africa [in 2009] and they won Copa America. How it is possible to say something against this kind of squad?\" Bebeto agreed that there were similarities between Dunga's team and that of 1994. \"It's a hard-working team. It will be very hard to score against Brazil,\" he said. \"I think they have the best defense in the world, starting with our goalkeeper -- that makes them similar to the champions in '94. \"When we won in '94, we were already together for 40 days. And that helped a lot. So we need to be patient, and let Dunga do his job. Players like Kaka and Robinho can make the difference. \"Luis Fabiano too, even if he's not in peak condition, and Kaka as well. But a player like Kaka, if he feels good, oh my God...\" Kaka has struggled to find form after an injury-hit first season with Real Madrid in Spain, having left Italian club AC Milan where he had been hailed as the best player in the world. Forward Robinho has regained the form that prompted English club Manchester City to break the British transfer record in 2008, but only after returning home on loan to Santos.",

At least 57 Iraqi civilians were killed and more than 120 others were wounded by what local officials say were Syrian warplanes that struck several border areas of Anbar province Tuesday. These border cities are among those under the control of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, which seeks to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses portions of Iraq in Syria. MAPS: How to understand the crisis . Reports of the Syrian incursion into Iraq is a reminder that the civil war in Syria and the unrest in Iraq are not isolated, but linked in ways that threaten the security of both. Sabah Karkhout, head of Iraq's Anbar provincial council, told CNN that Tuesday's air attacks struck markets and fuel stations in areas such as Rutba, al-Walid and Al-Qaim. \"Unfortunately, (the) Syrian regime carried out barbarian attacks against civilians in Anbar province,\" he said Wednesday. Karkhout said he was certain the warplanes were Syrian because they bore the image of the Syrian flag. \"Also, the planes flew directly from Syrian airspace and went back to Syria,\" he said. Local officials said residents used scopes and other equipment to see details on the warplanes. Iraq's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, denied reports that Syrian warplanes struck inside Iraq's border towns. \"We know our airspace. We have not recorded or registered infiltration of our air space from foreign jets, and all the warplanes and helicopters flying over Iraq airspace are Iraqis,\" he told CNN. The head of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, told reporters Wednesday that the warplanes that bombed the Iraqi cities were not Iraqi jets, but he did not have information beyond that. Syrian state media called the reports of a cross-border incursion \"completely baseless\" allegations made by \"malicious media outlets,\" citing a \"Syrian media source.\" CNN is seeking a response from the Syrian government in Damascus. Iraq's border region has been targeted by Syria in the past -- as the Syrian conflict escalated in 2012, there was at least one instance where rockets fired from Syria landed in Al-Qaim. Iraq's Foreign Ministry said at the time that it was ready to respond in the event of additional attacks from Syria, but the Iraqi government was noticeably quiet after Tuesday's incursion. The claims come as Iraqi forces continue fighting radical Sunni militants from ISIS. Inside Syria, the government, for the most part, appears to have avoided directly targeting ISIS, even though the group's positions are well known. Only in the last week did the Syrian regime intensify strikes on Raqqa, a city in Syria's interior that is considered ISIS's headquarters. Warplanes carried out seven raids on Raqqa on Wednesday, killing at least 12 people, including a woman and child, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Whether the strikes signify a concerted effort by Syria to intensify its fight against ISIS is yet to be seen. It is also unclear whether the Syrian strikes in Iraq were a unilateral action or were coordinated with the Iraqi government. Al-Maliki slams Sunnis . The sectarian rift in Iraq may have widened Wednesday when Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki blamed his political rivals for \"coordinating\" the crisis. Al-Maliki, a Shiite, accused Sunnis of collaborating with militants and slammed the call to have a national salvation government that would remove him from power. \"Iraq is facing a cross-border terrorist attack that is supported by some neighboring countries,\" al-Maliki said in a televised speech. He appealed to his Shia constituency by saying he is adhering to the wishes of Shiite religious leader Ali Sistani, who called for volunteers to support the Iraqi army and government. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry downplayed al-Maliki's rejection of a salvation government, saying it wasn't something the United States had talked to him about specifically. To the contrary, he said al-Maliki, is committed to the electoral process and creation of a new government that the United States has supported. \"And he committed to moving forward with the constitutional processes of government formation, and that is precisely what the United States was encouraging,\" Kerry said. \"He also called on all Iraqis to put aside their differences, to unite in their efforts against terrorism.\" Meanwhile, a U.S. official told CNN that Iran is flying surveillance drones over Iraq. It's not known from where they are being launched. Iran is believed to be providing small arms and ammunition to Iraq, as well as providing intelligence to al-Maliki's government, the official said. Is Baghdad ready for an ISIS attack? Meanwhile, on the outskirts of Baghdad, the eerie emptiness of a major highway raises questions about whether the capital would be prepared for a militant invasion. The Iraqi military insists it's ready to beat back ISIS if the fighters reach Baghdad. A post-battle video purportedly shows army forces celebrating a victory over ISIS just west of Baghdad. The bodies of two militants are draped over the hood of a Humvee. \"Look at those ISIS! We killed them!\" one man says in the video. But the opponents are formidable. ISIS fighters have captured cities and towns across Iraq in its effort to create an Islamic state. And the highway from Baghdad to Abu Ghraib in Anbar province showed few signs of readiness for ISIS. No tanks or big guns could be seen, CNN's Nic Robertson said. What used to be a thriving roadside marketplace now looks like a deserted wasteland. It's unclear what lies farther down the highway, but images on the Internet suggest a dire situation. Photos posted by ISIS show two soldiers sitting cross-legged on the ground, guns pointed at their heads. At least six civilians were killed and 21 wounded Wednesday when an Iraqi military helicopter fired two rockets on a mosque and nearby house in central Ana, in Anbar province, according to police and health officials. Most of the injured were children, who were attending a course on the Quran inside the targeted mosque, the officials said. At least 12 people were killed and 46 others were wounded when  a suicide bomber exploded in a popular coffee shop in Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad, followed by several mortar rounds attacked several locations nearby. At least four people were killed and 11 others were wounded when a car bomb exploded in an outdoor market in Rahimawa in northern Kirkuk, police officials in Kirkuk told CNN. Who has what? Maj. Gen Atta said security forces had regained control of two key border crossings after briefly losing them to the militants. Atta said Iraqi forces, aided by Sunni tribes, retook al-Walid, which connects Iraq with Syria. He also said Iraqi forces regained the Trebil border crossing between Iraq and Jordan. He also said that all towns between Samarra and Baghdad, 80 miles (129 kilometers) to the south, are in the hands of Iraqi security forces. But large swaths of Iraq, particularly in the north and west, have fallen from government control to the hands of ISIS. U.S. officials say they think ISIS now has as many as 10,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria. But  is unknown, officials say, exactly how many are in Iraq because it's not clear how many go back and forth across the Syrian border and how many loyalists have joined ISIS as it has taken over various towns. The spread of ISIS . Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said he fears the strength of radical militants could spill further across borders. \"We've been saying for a while that the rise and spread of extremism and the politics of exclusivity will threaten the security of the entire region,\" Judeh told CNN's Becky Anderson. \"The root cause of ethnic and sectarian division, the root cause of instability and the rise and spread of terrorism and extremism has to be addressed.\" MAPS: How to understand the crisis .

Poyet limps into the game on the back of a dismal goalless draw with West Brom last week and an FA Cup defeat at Bradford which raised some speculation over his future at the Stadium of Light. But the Uruguayan has been buoyed by the memory of Sebastian Larsson's winner in last season's corresponding fixture as part of a four-game winning streak which sealed their unlikely survival bid. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet says he will unleash his attacking players at Manchester United on Saturday . Sebastian Larsson (number seven) is congratulated by team-mates after scoring against United last season . Poyet said: 'You cannot make (Jermain) Defoe, (Ricky) Alvarez or (Adam) Johnson become robots and do what you want all the time. They have to have the freedom to go forward and express themselves. 'I think the mix has to be right - it is not perfect at the moment but we are still working on it.' Sunderland's win at Old Trafford last year was their first since 1968 and Poyet believes that factor could work to the Black Cats' advantage as they seek to find the momentum to escape their latest relegation battle. Poyet added: 'It is true that there is something different when you don't win for years and years in a place and you go there and it looks like it is going to be more difficult than ever, and we did change that. 'I think that is going to bring something different to the players - at least those who have been here a while.'

Sunderland winger Adam Johnson takes on West Brom midfielder Chris brunt before drilling in a cross . Jermain Defoe skips out of the way of Brunt's challenge during Sunderland's draw with West Brom . But Poyet warned the extent of United's current travails have been greatly exaggerated and believes Louis Van Gaal's men are still on course for a top-four finish. United's surprise defeat at Swansea last weekend heaped more pressure on the Dutchman in light of recent questions over his style of play since arriving to replace David Moyes last summer. Poyet said: 'I think it is going to be a totally different game - nothing compared to last year when Ryan Giggs was their caretaker and we were playing for our lives. 'Now they are in the process of changing their style of play - for a team that has been playing for 20-plus years in the same way it is going to be a difficult process. 'I think people are being a little bit harsh on Manchester United at the moment. They are not as bad as people think because they are in a good position, and if they get in the top four a few people are going to have to recognise they have done better than people expected.' Poyet suffered a blow this week with the news that Italian striker Emanuele Giaccherini is almost certain to miss the remainder of the season after undergoing ankle surgery. But his squad is otherwise nearing full fitness with only Billy Jones and Jack Rodwell struggling for the Old Trafford trip, and more likely to be rested with a view to returning for Tuesday night's crucial trip to Hull.

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\n(CNN) -- Last Saturday morning, when media crews outside the Sikh gurdwara (house of worship) in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, packed up their trucks to chase the news of Mitt Romney's choice for vice president, Sikh Americans were left reflecting on six days of unprecedented national attention. After the shooting of six people in a Sikh gurdwara, a stream of national leaders, from the Rev. Jesse Jackson to Gov. Scott Walker, came to offer condolences and support. But there was one person missing. It was you, Mr. President. Let me be clear: Your administration's response to the massacre has been strong and swift. Attorney General Eric Holder addressed mourners with compassion and resolve at the Friday memorial.: \"In the recent past, too many Sikhs have been targeted and victimized simply because of who they are, how they look, and what they believe,\" he said.. \"This is wrong. It is unacceptable. And it will not be tolerated.\" Joshua Dubois from the White House expressed his full commitment to helping us with sustained interfaith and education outreach. The FBI and Department of Justice were at the top of their game, investigating the attacks as both an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime. But we need more than government cooperation. Our community needs the deeper spiritual and emotional assurance that we are welcome to live, work and worship as fellow Americans. The gunman, Wade Michael Page, was a member of a white supremacist group that wishes to destroy our very claim to call this country home. After the attack we endured, Sikh Americans, and all brown and black people in America for that matter, need our president to directly show the nation that we belong here. Watch: Volunteers help temple mourners cope . President Obama, you flew to Aurora, Colorado, to mourn publicly with the families before the dead were buried. You hugged your daughters closer that night, imagining them in that theater. In response to the massacre of Sikhs in Oak Creek, you and Mitt Romney issued statements of support, but did not suspend campaigning in Wisconsin, as you did in Colorado. Of the major networks, only CNN sent an anchor to report live from Oak Creek, and none of the networks covered the murders as extensively as they did in Colorado. We worry that because the victims were brown-skinned people with \"foreign\" names, the tragedy hasn't elicited the same attention from public officials and the media. I believe you can help the nation feel our pain. You can show this tragedy is an American tragedy, because none of us should have to fear gunfire in their own churches, synagogues and mosques. If Trayvon Martin could have been your son, and the kids in the Aurora theater your daughters, then the aunts and uncles shot while praying on that Sunday could have also been your own. We wish you were there on Thursday morning when community members entered their gurdwara for the first time since the massacre. You would have witnessed the spirit of chardi kala in the Sikh faith -- even in darkness, a rising resilience -- and shared this spirit, which is also part of the American character. Sikh women and men walked into a crime scene: blood on the carpets, there were bullet holes in the walls, and shattered windows. They flew into action, ripping out carpets, painting over bullet holes, scrubbing floors, and within hours, they served the first langar (open meal), breaking bread beneath portraits of those who have died for our faith. Opinion: Why American Sikhs will survive . We wish you were there later that night for the town hall meeting organized by your Justice Department. Nearly every Sikh American told officials that the attack on Sunday was not isolated or \"senseless,\" but one in a long pattern of intentional acts of hate and discrimination in the last decade and long before. Our children are bullied in schools, our men and women are profiled at airports and barred from military service unless they give up their turbans, and our people endure racial slurs and hate crimes that are not specifically tracked by the FBI. You would have heard the community's cry for help and publicly called upon all Americans to recommit to curbing the alarming rise of hate and fear in this country. News: Holder calls Sikh temple shooting a hate crime . We wish you were there on Friday morning for the memorial for the dead. Three thousand people filled the Oak Creek High School gymnasium, a sea of people sitting in reverence and sorrow before six open caskets. We are deeply moved that you ordered the flags lowered to half-mast, an expression of respect and honor.

His blood alcohol level was five times the legal limit, Dominican Republic attorney general's office spokeswoman Tessie Sanchez revealed to the Associated Press on Tuesday. She also described him as 'legally intoxicated when he crashed' to the wire service. In a Tuesday statement, General Manager John Mozeliak and the St. Louis Cardinals said 'We have seen the media reports regarding Oscar Taveras that have come out this afternoon, but have yet to receive any official notification from the Dominican. Until we have the opportunity to review the official report, we cannot confirm details. Scroll down for video . Accident: An official has said the blood alcohol level of St. Louis Cardinals player Oscar Taveras, pictured, was reportedly five times the legal limit . Victim: Also killed in the October 26 car crash in the Dominican Republic was Taveras' girlfriend, 18-year-old Edilia Arvelo . Remembered: Mourners are seen carrying the casket of Oscar Taveras last month in the Dominican Republic . Accident: Taveras died on October 26, less than a year after he made his Major League debut with the St. Louis Cardinals . Funeral: Mourners are seen placing their  hands on Taveras' casket in Puerto Plata. Taveras' blood alcohol level was reportedly five times over the legal limit at the time of the crash . Procession: In this Oct. 28, 2014, file photo, people march as a hearse carries the coffin containing Taveras' body his funeral procession in Sosua, Dominican Republic . 'While we are still working to obtain the facts, it won't change the fact that this is a terrible tragedy. We have an obligation to use this as an opportunity to educate our players that they must take responsibility for themselves both on and off the field.' Taveras died in a car crash less than a year after making his Major League Baseball debut. The 22-year-old slugger's death was confirmed by his agent and newspapers in his native Dominican Republic, after he was involved in a traffic accident there on October 26. 'He wasn't carrying documents at the time of the accident, but his body was identified by family members,' Col. Diego Pesqueira of the Metropolitan Transportation Agency said of Taveras. Taveras was driving a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro at the time of the accident on a highway between the beaches of Sosua and Cabarete in Puerto Plata, about 215 miles north of the capital of Santo Domingo. Edilia Arvelo, Taveras' 18-year-old girlfriend, also died in the crash. A funeral for Taveras was held October 27 in Puerto Plata, while a funeral for Arvelo was held in her hometown of Moca that same day. Couple: Taveras was with Edilia Arvelo while driving on a highway between the beaches of Sosua and Cabarete in Puerto Plata . Promising: Taveras, seen October 12, \u00a0was regarded as one of baseball's top prospects and homered in his major league debut May 31 . Crash: Taveras and his girlfriend were in this 2014 Chevrolet Camaro . Hope: The Cardinals had just finalized plans for Taveras to spend most of November at the team's spring training facility in Jupiter, Florida, and then head to the Dominican Winter League . Taveras was a teenager when he signed with St. Louis as an international free agent in 2008. He was regarded as one of baseball's top prospects and homered in his major league debut May 31. He also had a big solo drive in the seventh inning of Game 2 in the NL Championship Series against San Francisco. The Cardinals had just finalized plans for Taveras to spend most of November at the team's spring training facility in Jupiter, Florida, and then head to the Dominican Winter League. Taveras lost the regular right fielder job to fellow rookie Randal Grichuk, but that did not diminish the organization's long-term view that Taveras could be a star. Taveras hit .239 with three homers and 22 RBIs in 80 games in his only season in the majors. Athlete: Taveras hit .239 with three homers and 22 RBIs in 80 games in his only season in the majors . Taveras was a teenager when he signed with St. Louis as an international free agent in 2008 . 'All of us throughout Major League Baseball are in mourning this evening,' baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said in a release the day of the car crash. 'Oscar, a young member of the baseball family, was full of promise and at the dawn of a wonderful career in our game, evident in his game-tying home run against the Giants exactly two weeks ago.' 'He was someone that became an identity of our organization to some degree,' Mozeliak said in a conference call the day after Taveras' death. 'When you think about how much has been written about him and how much has been talked about him, he never truly got a chance to show it at the major league level.' Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said the day after Taveras' death 'In my opinion, the word \"love\" is the most misused, and misunderstood word in the English language. It is not popular for men to use this word, and even less popular for athletes. But, there is not a more accurate word for how a group of men share a deep and genuine concern for each other. We loved Oscar, and he loved us. That is what a team does, that is what a family does. You will be missed, Oscar.' Matheny was a catcher for the Cardinals when pitcher Darryl Kile died of a heart problem in June 2002. St. Louis also lost Josh Hancock in a fatal car crash in April 2007. Each of those deaths occurred during the season, but the accident for Taveras happened with his teammates at home after losing to San Francisco in the NL Championship Series. Many of them took to Twitter to express their condolences. 'Absolute tragedy,' teammate Matt Carpenter tweeted after hearing the news. 'My prayers go out to Oscar [Taveras'] family.' 'We mourn the passing of Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras,' the MLB tweeted. 'Last 30 minutes I've been sick to my stomach. Keep thinking about Oscar's big smile in the dugout whenever we made a big play/got a big hit,' All-Star reliever Pat Neshek posted the day of the car crash.",

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has suggested Australia is prepared to send military forces to Iraq if that's what is needed to prevent genocide by the 'murderous hordes' fighting for Islamic State. Mr Abbott on Tuesday said he agreed with US President Barack Obama that the situation in northern Iraq was 'potential genocide'. 'No one wants to stand aside in the face of a potential genocide,' the prime minister said following talks with the British prime minister, senior UK ministers and intelligence officers in London. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has suggested Australia is prepared to send military forces to Iraq . Mr Abbott gave a press conference following talks with the British prime minister, senior UK ministers and intelligence officers in London . Asked if that could include military action Mr Abbott replied: 'Well we certainly don't rule that out.' 'We are talking to our security partners about what we can usefully do to help,' Mr Abbott said. 'The United Kingdom and Australia, and the United States, are acutely conscious of the potential for genocide on Mount Sinjar and elsewhere in northern Iraq and we will do what we reasonably can to protect people.' The Liberal leader stressed there was a fundamental difference between getting involved to prevent genocide and past western interventions in the region for 'geopolitical objectives'. 'This is a fundamentally humanitarian mission designed to protect innocent men, women and children from the murderous hordes that currently confront them,' he said, adding terrorists had been 'crucifying, decapitating, summarily executing people and dealing in a hideous way with woman and children as well as with men'. It's thought 60 Australians are fighting with Islamic State or offshoots in Iraq and Syria. Another 90 Australians are likely supporting them from back home. Mr Abbott on Tuesday said he agreed with US President Barack Obama that the situation in northern Iraq was 'potential genocide' Mr Abbott said he was conscious other countries had a greater capacity to act militarily but insisted 'Australia is not without capacity and we want to use the capacity we have for good'. He refused to say if he'd discussed the issue with Mr Obama but AAP understands he hasn't because Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Defence Minister David Johnston have held talks with their US counterparts John Kerry and Chuck Hagel in Sydney. Jihadist militants have attacked the large town of Sinjar forcing thousands of mainly Yazidi civilians to flee up a mountain and hide there with little food and water. An international effort is underway to deliver aid to them and hundreds of thousands of other refugees in Kurdistan. Mr Abbott on Tuesday confirmed Australian aircraft will 'shortly' join the humanitarian effort. The Prime Minister stressed there was a fundamental difference between getting involved to prevent genocide and past western interventions in the region for 'geopolitical objectives' It's expected two RAAF C-130 transporters will be assisting with airdrops by the end of the week. The planes, based in Al Minhad in the United Arab Emirates, are awaiting aid supplies to arrive from Australia. Mr Abbott on Tuesday spoke with David Cameron on the phone as the British prime minister is currently on holiday overseas. But he talked in person with UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. The Australian PM also met with the chairman of the UK joint intelligence committee, John Day, and received a broader security briefing at Thames House. He'll depart for Australia on Wednesday morning arriving home on Thursday night Australian time.",

Dana Rohrabacher that led to a government spokesman saying the congressman and his delegation are not welcome in the country. Embassy spokesman David Ranz issued a statement Saturday saying \"congressional visitors do not necessarily express the views of the U.S. administration or even a majority of Congress. The visitors this weekend made that clear in their remarks.\" In widely reported statements after a meeting Friday with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, the California Republican said he informed the Iraqi leader that his House committee is investigating the killing of Iranian exiles by Iraqi forces. Rohrabacher, the chairman of the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also told reporters during a news conference at the embassy in Baghdad that he suggested Iraq repay some of the cost of the war. \"Once Iraq becomes a very rich and prosperous country ... we would hope that some consideration be given to repaying the United States some of the mega-dollars that we have spent here in the last eight years,\" said Rohrabacher, according to the Agence France-Presse news agency. CNN could not independently confirm the comments that were attributed to Rohrabacher. Multiple calls to his Washington and California offices were not immediately returned. It was unclear whether the U.S. Embassy recorded the news conference. It did not make any video or audio recordings of Rohrabacher's statements available to the media. Iraq has informed the embassy that the delegation is no longer welcome, Ali al-Dabbagh, Iraq's government spokesman, said Saturday. \"We have contacted the U.S. Embassy and they said the remarks of Congressman Dana Rohrabacher expressed his own opinion and not the official opinion of the United States,\" the spokesman said. Al-Dabbagh said the relationship between Iraq and United States is still solid and would not be hurt by Rohrabacher's remarks. Ranz declined to confirm the conversation, saying \"we do not comment on private diplomatic exchanges.\" Rohrabacher's comments come at a delicate time for al-Maliki, who is consulting with his government about whether to ask to extend U.S. troops beyond a January 1, 2012, deadline to withdraw. About 47,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq, down from 170,000 in 2007, during the peak of sectarian violence. Rohrabacher's trip was characterized partly as a fact-finding mission over clashes in April between Iraqi forces and Iranian exiles at Camp Ashraf that left 34 people dead and more than 200 wounded. Traveling with Rohrabacher were Democratic Rep. Russ Carnahan of Missouri; Rep. Ted Poe of Texas, a Republican member of Rohrabacher's subcommittee; Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina; Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas; and Democratic Rep. Jim Costa of California. Telephone calls to the district and Washington offices of all five congressmen were either not answered or not immediately returned. Rohrabacher has said his delegation was denied permission by al-Maliki to visit the camp, home to some 3,300 members of an Iranian guerilla group that fought against Iran's government and were given haven by Saddam Hussein's Sunni-majority government. Iraq has ordered the camp be closed by the end of the year and wants the residents to leave the country. The residents are refusing to budge, and do not recognize Iraqi sovereignty over their camp. The result has been a number of deadly clashes in recent years. The United States considers the group, known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, or MEK, to be a terrorist organization. The Iranian dissidents say they will be killed if they are returned to Iran. The U.S. has proposed a plan that would temporarily relocate the MEK within Iraq, farther from the border with Iran. Under the plan, they would later be relocated to other countries. That would not include the United States, since U.S. law bars anyone associated with a terrorist organization from settling there.

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\nWashington (CNN) -- In direct and emotional terms, President Barack Obama informed the nation and the world Sunday night that a U.S. operation in Pakistan earlier in the day killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden almost 10 years after terrorist attacks that killed thousands. \"I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women and children,\" the president said, looking directly into the television camera in the East Room of the White House for the statement broadcast nationwide on short notice. It was a triumphant moment for Obama and U.S. security forces, particularly an intelligence community that has been maligned for its failure to head off the 2001 attacks and subsequent breakdowns in cohesion. \"On nights like this one, we can say to those families who lost loved ones to al Qaeda's terror: justice has been done,\" Obama declared. He called bin Laden a mass murderer and said that \"his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and dignity.\" As he spoke, top officials including Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, CIA Director Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen looked on in the East Room. \"For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaeda's leader and symbol and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies,\" Obama said. \"The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al Qaeda.\" The president described the intelligence process that culminated in acquiring actionable information on bin Laden's whereabouts in recent months. \"Last August, after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community, I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden,\" Obama said. \"It was far from certain. And it took many months to run this thread to ground. I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we could locate bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside Pakistan.\" According to senior administration officials, Obama chaired five National Security Council meetings in recent months, with the two most recent ones on April 19 and April 28, before giving the order Friday -- a day he spent in Alabama visiting storm-damaged areas of the state -- to proceed with the mission. Last week, Obama said, \"I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.\" \"Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan,\" the president continued. \"A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight they killed Osama Bin Laden and took custody of his body.\" Senior administration officials told reporters on condition of not being identified that the surgical strike involved a helicopter raid on the heavily secured compound that lasted less than 40 minutes. The U.S. forces engaged in a firefight with bin Laden and others that killed five people -- bin Laden, three male accomplices and a woman whom one of the male combatants used as a human shield, the officials said. One U.S. helicopter crashed due to a mechanical problem and was destroyed, the officials added. In his remarks, Obama recounted the 2001 terrorist attacks, referring to the clear blue skies that day and the horror of planes slamming into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. He also spoke of families who lost loved ones that day, the intelligence community that finally tracked bin Laden down, and \"the men who carried out this operation.\" \"It was nearly 10 years ago that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history,\" Obama said. \"The images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory -- hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky; the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground; black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon; the wreckage of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction.\" He went on to describe the worst images -- \"those that were unseen to the world.\" \"The empty seat at the dinner table. Children who were forced to grow up without their mother or their father. Parents who would never know the feeling of their child's embrace. Nearly 3,000 citizens taken from us, leaving a gaping hole in our hearts,\" Obama said. \"Tonight we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who have worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome,\" Obama said. \"The American people do not see their work nor know their names, but tonight they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice.\" Thanking the U.S. forces in Sunday's operation, Obama said they \"exemplify the professionalism, patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country. And they are part of a generation that has borne the heaviest share of burden since that September day.\" \"Let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11, that we have never forgotten your loss, nor wavered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores,\" he said. \"And tonight, let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11. I know that it has, at times, frayed. Yet today's achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people.\" Obama also repeated the longstanding U.S. contention that originated with former President George W. Bush after the 2001 attacks that the fight against al Qaeada was not a war against Islam. \"I've made clear, just as President Bush did shortly after 9/11, that our war is not against Islam,\" Obama said. \"Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader. He was a mass murderer of Muslims. Indeed, al Qaeda slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries including our own.\"",

An international arrest warrant was issued Saturday for the legal adviser on sex-trafficking charges. Salvadoran police raided a home in May that turned up passports and an ID card in the names of both Jorge Torres Puello and his alias, Jorge Torres Orellana. Each of the documents bore photos of the same man. His wife was arrested in that raid and charged with sex trafficking, and her trial is pending. In a phone interview with CNN on Sunday, Jorge Torres Puello acknowledged he is the same man wanted by Salvadoran authorities. He denied the charges against him. Full coverage of the earthquake aftermath in Haiti . According to the warrant, Torres Puello is accused of running an international sex trafficking ring that lured women and girls from the Caribbean and Central America into prostitution with offers of modeling jobs. A wanted poster released by Interpol, the international police organization, includes crimes against children as one of the offenses that Torres Puello is being sought for. \"I never did anything,\" Torres Puello said Sunday. \"I started helping a Dominican pastor helping a lot of people who were stranded to get back to their home countries. We once gave some Nicaraguan and Costa Rican women some money to return home and instead they went to the authorities and put in a complaint against us. I never had anybody against their will.\" Torres Puello also denied Salvadoran allegations that he ran a brothel out of his home with wife Ana Josefa Ramirez Orellana, who remains jailed pending trial, according to Salvadoran police. \"I want to clear the Salvador matter up and I am hiring a lawyer to do that,\" he said. \"I know I am innocent and I want to clear my past.\" His mother, Soledad Puello, told CNN Sunday that she first heard of the Salvadoran accusations when her son called to tell her of his wife's arrest. She said her son told her he had known about the sex ring, but wasn't involved in it. Soledad Puello led CNN to believe that her son remained in the Dominican Republic, but she would not say where. Torres Puello, who said he was born in Yonkers, New York, in 1977 to a Dominican mother and a Puerto Rican father, also said he is wanted in the United States on charges of smuggling people between Canada and the United States, which he also denied. He said he spent 18 months in a Canadian jail pending what he called an unsuccessful extradition request by U.S. authorities. He has served jail time in the United States before, he said -- one year in 1998 for handling funds related to a drug-trafficking operation, and was jailed again briefly between late 2001 and January 2002 for violating parole. He denied the drug charge. Both his mother and Torres Puello say he served briefly in the U.S. Army in a military intelligence unit, and Torres Puello said he also worked undercover with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. A family photo shows Torres Puello in a military uniform alongside a truck with the words \"U.S. Military\" printed across the bumper. CNN was unable to reach government officials to confirm his claims of working with the military, the DEA and Homeland Security. Torres Puello's statements regarding the charges against him could not be immediately verified. But on Sunday, four men showed up at his mother's home while CNN reporters were present. The men said they were from the U.S. Embassy and looking for Torres Puello. One of the men told Soledad Puello that her son has three outstanding arrest warrants -- two in the United States and one in El Salvador. He did not specify the charges. One of the men was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \"U.S. Marshals Service, Fugitive Task Force.\" Torres Puello said he made contact with the Central Valley Church in Idaho and their family representatives and offered to provide legal assistance to the American missionaries shortly after they were jailed in January after trying to cross the Dominican border carrying 33 children without proper documentation. Family representatives in Idaho did not give the exact date when they were contacted by Puello but said it was \"shortly after their arrest\". Hiram Sasser, attorney with Liberty Legal of Plano, Texas, sought to distance his client, Jim Allen, from Torres Puello. He stated in an e-mail to CNN: \"No attorney has ever been authorized to represent Jim Allen other than our team, which includes Mr. Lissade. The only spokesperson for the Allen family has been me and our team.\" Haitian attorney Louis Gary Lissade showed up at court in Port-au-Prince on February 9 to represent Allen, one of the 10 Americans. Another of Allen's U.S. defense team, Reginald Brown, said he, Sasser and other U.S. attorneys were only hired to represent Allen on Super Bowl Sunday -- nine days after the Americans were arrested. In a February 9 letter from Brown to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Brown stated: \"It's our understanding from press reports ... that all 10 Americans were represented by a single Haitian attorney. ... We're not able to confirm if that counsel was independently chosen by Jim [Allen].\" Until February 7, Torres Puello said he had been appointed legal adviser to all 10 Americans and Haitian attorney Edwin Coq said he was handling the case in Port-au-Prince on behalf of all 10. Coq, who was the attorney Brown referred to in his letter to Clinton, says he resigned on February 6 over a dispute about payments. Torres Puello said he had fired Coq. Torres Puello turned up at court Monday, February 8, saying he was there to organize legal representation for all 10 Americans after Coq left the case. Torres Puello said he read about the case and decided to offer his services for free. However, Torres Puello's stepfather, Franco Ceminara, said the arrested Americans' families had already wired more than $40,000 to his stepson. A receipt provided by Torres Puello's family to CNN showed the Haitian lawyers are charging $40,000 to represent the Americans. The receipt, for an advance payment of $10,000, was signed by Aviol Fleurant, one of the Americans' Port-au-Prince-based defense team that also includes Lissade. Family and church representatives in Idaho, where most of the 10 Americans are from, told CNN earlier in the week that they had not paid money to the man they know as Jorge Puello. Regarding the American missionaries, Torres Puello said: \"Prior to this earthquake I never knew those people [the Americans]. When I read about their case I just decided to help them. I'm in the real estate business and was working with a team of lawyers.\"",

Roddy MacDonald died after staff served him the wrong meal. The 84-year-old had Parkinson\u2019s Disease, making it difficult for him to chew or swallow. All his meals needed to be mashed and soft to prevent him choking but he was given a plate of beef goulash. Grandfather Roddy MacDonald, 84, died after staff served him the wrong meal. Here he is pictured with his wife Margaret, who died in 2012 . Mr MacDonald's son Craig said his father was a 'great dad and a great granddad - my kids adored him'. He is pictured here with his grandchildren before his death . Mr MacDonald's daughter-in-law Elizabeth (left)  and son Craig (right) launched a compensation claim against the hospital trust and were awarded \u00a320,000 . The pensioner, who had been due to go home from Glasgow\u2019s Gartnavel Hospital after recovering from a urine infection, tried to eat the dinner and choked. A doctor reportedly broke some of his ribs trying to resuscitate him but Mr MacDonald, a war veteran, could not be saved. His death certificate gave the main cause of death as \u2018choked on food\u2019. Yesterday his family, who have just received \u00a320,000 in compensation for his death in 2011, spoke out. His son, Craig MacDonald, said: \u2018My dad was a proud man who served in the army during the war. He had many good years ahead of him and it's such a shame his life ended the way it did. \u2018It would have been easier to take if he had died of a heart attack but to think he was killed by the neglect of the people who were supposed to be caring for him is hard to take.\u2019 Mr MacDonald\u2019s family printed out a laminated diet sheet with his food requirements on it to prevent any mistakes from happening. His Parkinson\u2019s put him at severe risk of choking by weakening the muscles in his jaw and face, making it harder for him to chew and swallow. He was put on a \u2018pre-mashed\u2019 diet, meaning food should be soft, tender and moist with little chewing required. Relatives said they first complained to nurses when he was instead served \u2018fork-mashable\u2019 food, which needs more chewing than was safe. His daughter-in-law, healthcare assistant Elizabeth MacDonald, said: \u2018We found out the diet sheet we had made for Roddy had been lost, along with his notes, and turned up in a drawer. \u2018Feeding someone the right food should be one of the most basic things to get right in hospital. It should never ever have happened. Mr MacDonald suffered from Parkinson's Disease, which meant he had problems chewing and swallowing. He was put on a 'pre-mashed' diet but doctors mistakenly fed him goulash. Here, he is pictured with wife Margaret . Mr MacDonald with his granddaughter (right, and alone, left). He had been in hospital for three weeks when he died, surrounded by his wife, son and daughter-in-law . \u2018When he was given the beef goulash, we don\u2019t know how long he was choking for. \u2018A doctor tried to resuscitate him and we later found out broke a few of his ribs. They put him on a breathing machine and he died the same day.\u2019 The pensioner had been in hospital for three weeks when he died, surrounded by his wife, son and daughter-in-law. A report from an expert witness found, the family said, that he was also given the wrong dosage of a Parkinson\u2019s drug. He lost 10 per cent of his body weight in hospital but was not referred to a dietitian. They also say he was given an adult pad, even though he was not incontinent, because staff would not take him to the toilet. Mr MacDonald\u2019s death was reported to the Procurator Fiscal and his family launched a claim for compensation, which was settled for \u00a320,000. A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which runs Gartnavel, said: \u2018This is a tragic case and our sympathies remain with the family. Craig McDonald said of his father: 'My dad was a proud man who served in the army during the war. He had many good years ahead of him and it's such a shame his life ended the way it did' \u2018We accept that there were failings in the care of Mr MacDonald.

Jerrod Metsker pleaded guilty to murdering Reann Murphy, whose body was found dumped in a trash can at the trailer park where they both lived. The nine-year-old had last been seen building a snowman with Metsker, just hours before she disappeared on December 14 last year. Plea deal: Jerrod Metsker has been sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to raping and murdering his nine-year-old neighbor . Victim: Reann Murphy's body was found buried under trash one day after she had been seen building a snowman with Metsker . A plea deal was agreed with Metsker, who has a low IQ, after his victim's parents said they did not want to pursue the death penalty. Under the deal Metsker, who was described in court as a family friend, pleaded guilty to aggravated murder and rape. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole. The county sheriff's office had said early in its investigation that Metsker had a 'diminished mental capacity' but declined to reveal further details of his condition. The 24-year-old had been the one to call 911 on the day Reann died, and had joined neighbors in the search for the missing girl. Guilty: Metsker, pictured right during a hearing in December last year, was charged with aggravated murder . Heartbroken: Reann with her family. Her parents told the court they didn't want to pursue the death penalty . Crime scene: Police search the trailer park where Reann and Metsker both lived at the time of her murder in December 2013 . One day later, Reann's body was found in a dumpster at the Smithville trailer park where she lived. Loss: Reann was described by family as a firecracker who loved to be outside . She had been sexually assaulted and . strangled, most likely in Metsker's trailer home which he shared with . his mother, prosecutors said. Metsker often played outside with children who lived at the trailer park, and would build playhouses out of blankets, neighbors said. He met Reann when she moved to the trailer park with her mother at the start of the school year. Reann's mother had been at work on the Saturday that she went missing. She had left her daughter in the care of her live-in boyfriend. The nine-year-old had gone outside to play in the snow with other children in the trailer park, but when the others went home she was left alone with Metsker. Relatives described Reann as a tomboy and said that she had loved to play outside. 'She was a little firecracker, always ready to wrestle and play,' her cousin Paula Watts said. 'She wasn't into girlie stuff.' Although she lived with her mother, she still spent plenty of time with her father, Richard Murphy, who described her as 'the best thing that ever happened to me'. Problems: Police described 24-year-old Metsker as having a low IQ. He often played with neighborhood children .",

A truck burns at the gate to the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad before a larger, deadly explosion Saturday. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the Saturday attack at the Marriott Hotel \"is the biggest attack, volume-wise\" in Pakistan in seven years. Two American military personnel who worked for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad were among those killed, the U.S. military said. A Lithuanian and the Czech Republic's ambassador to Pakistan, Ivo Zdarek, also were among the fatalities, police superintendent Sheikh Zubair said. The suicide truck blast injured 266 people, including 11 foreigners, according to Malik.  Watch guards scatter after an explosion \u00bb . British Airways temporarily suspended its flights to Islamabad as a result of the security situation, according to an airline spokeswoman who did not want to be named. A Sunday night flight has been canceled, and the airline is reviewing its operations for later in the week. British Airways operates at least three flights a week to the Pakistani capital out of London's Heathrow Airport. At a news conference in Islamabad on Sunday, Pakistani authorities released security video of the blast, showing a small explosion inside the truck before the larger, deadly explosion. Watch the truck bomb caught on tape . In the video, a large truck crashes into the security gate, sending one security officer scurrying for safety. Then, as security guards approach the truck, the top of the vehicle explodes and the security guards flee. A small cloud of smoke appears above the truck, which is engulfed in flames minutes later. One of the security guards tries to put out the fire with a hand-held extinguisher, to no avail. The guards then walk away, and the camera freezes on the burning truck. Pakistani officials said the blast apparently disrupted electricity to the area, causing the closed-circuit television camera to malfunction. No arrests have been made in connection with the attack, Malik said Sunday, adding that militants in Pakistan's tribal regions are suspected of orchestrating the attack. \"I am not in a position to tell you who has done it, but [in] all the previous investigations, all the roads have gone to South Waziristan,\" he said. South Waziristan is one of Pakistan's seven tribal areas where Taliban and al Qaeda militants are active. At the bombing site, video showed a deep crater in the pavement where the bomb detonated. More than a dozen cars were reduced to twisted steel. The crater was 24 feet deep and nearly 60 feet wide, Malik said. The blast also caused a natural gas leak that set the top floor of the five-story, 258-room hotel on fire, police said. The blaze quickly engulfed the entire structure.  Watch a witness describe walking over bodies \u00bb . Most of the fatalities appeared to be drivers, who were waiting with their cars outside the Marriott, and hotel security guards, Geo TV's Hamid Mir said. The hotel, where a standard room costs more than $300 per night, is near the compound that contains the Parliament building, the prime minister's house, the Supreme Court and the presidency. The blast occurred about 7:50 p.m., after the breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan, Malik said. Trees were felled by the explosion, which occurred hours after newly elected President Asif Ali Zardari addressed a joint session of Parliament and promised to root out terrorism.  Watch the scene the morning after the blast \u00bb . A few hours after the attack, Zardari addressed the nation on television, saying he knows the pain of terrorism after his wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was killed in December on the campaign trail. \"My heart cries tears of blood. I can understand your pain. I want to ask you to turn this pain into your strength,\" he said, describing extremism as \"a cancer, which we will finish.\" \"In the holy month of Ramadan, no Muslim can act in this way. These people are not Muslims,\" he said. \"I appeal to all democratic nations to help us get rid of this menace.\" The Marriott, a Western brand-name hotel, has been the site of attacks in the past.  See where the attack occurred \u00bb . Malik said authorities had received a threat against Parliament two days ago. \"We had taken all security measures,\" he said. \"There was heavy security in the city.\" Located near the diplomatic section of the city and heavily guarded by police and the military, the hotel is popular among tourists and had been packed Saturday night. Any vehicle entering the facility is searched, its underside checked for bombs, before it is allowed to pass through heavy steel gates.  Watch bombing victims rushed into hospital \u00bb . The British High Commission in Islamabad said six British nationals -- five adults and one minor -- were injured in the attack, including three commission members.

It's doable, according to the Union for International Cancer Control and International Agency for Research on Cancer, if countries adopt measures to meet the \"25 by 25\" targets the World Health Organization set last year. The targets aim to reduce premature deaths due to noncommunicable diseases by 25% by 2025. Cancer deaths total about 7.6 million worldwide each year. Of those, 4 million are in people ages 30 to 69 -- defined as \"premature\" by the two cancer organizations. \"With the right strategies, at least 30% of (all) cancer cases can be prevented based on current knowledge,\" according to the Union for International Cancer Control. The groups made the announcement Monday, the eighth World Cancer Day. The Union for International Cancer Control -- the largest nongovernmental cancer-fighting organization with more than 760 partners in 155 countries -- organized the day to raise awareness among individuals and governments about cancer and cancer prevention. More than 450 events were held to raise awareness Monday, the group said. This year's theme: to highlight and dispel myths and misconceptions about cancer, including that it is a \"disease of the wealthy, elderly and developed countries,\" according to the organization. In reality, cancer affects those of all ages and income levels worldwide. More lives being saved: Cancer death rates drop 20% . In fact, \"more (cancer) deaths occur in lower and middle-income countries, than in high-income high cancer countries, even though there are twice as many cases in high-income countries,\" said Peter Boyle, president of the International Prevention Research Institute in Lyon, France. Boyle is the main author of World Breast Cancer Report 2012, which was published by the institute and funded by Susan G. Komen for the Cure. It was released Monday. According to his report, more than 1.6 million women worldwide will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, compared with about 641,000 in 1980. More than 425,000 will die from the disease each year. \"I was shocked by some of the things we found,\" Boyle said, adding he believes there are various reasons why women in poorer countries are diagnosed late. Lack of treatment is one. He cites an example: In Bangladesh, there is one trained oncologist for 150 million people. There's also a lot of stigma preventing women from seeking treatment. \"It's a very, very sad thing,\" Boyle said. For example, in Kenya and Uganda, 100% of women seek help with advanced or metastatic breast cancer, said Boyle. Metastatic breast cancer means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body; advanced breast cancer means it's the most advanced stage of breast cancer that has not spread outside the breast. In both cases, a late diagnosis can impede efforts toward a cure. By comparison, the report said, \"It is calculated that less than 10% of the breast cancer patients in the U.S. are diagnosed with LABC (locally advanced breast cancer). Women in the United States are not immune from late diagnoses.\" After cancer, my real fight began . Julie Gerberding, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Monday addressed the Global Women's Cancer Summit in Washington, a gathering the Komen Foundation hosted. She described three women who died from cancer, either because they didn't know they had the disease or didn't take advantage of screening. They were her aunts, she said, and lived in the United States. Two had breast cancer, and one had cervical cancer. Gerberding said it's a problem \"from Arkansas all the way to Zimbabwe.\" \"We must get better at implementing what we already know,\" said Gerberding, who is now president of Merck Vaccines. The summit launched its own \"25\" goal: to improve breast cancer survival and quality of life in 2.5 million women living in low- and middle-income countries by 2025. So much could be done, Boyle said, if existing prevention screening techniques such as mammography and breast self-exams were used and existing treatments were available. He quoted the popular Nike slogan \"just do it.\" \"If every woman in the world had adequate knowledge of breast cancer, had access to early diagnostic programs, had access to high-quality diagnostic services and (was) treated according to the most appropriate protocol for their particular disease, then breast cancer mortality would drop rapidly and significantly and have a profound effect on global women's health,\" according to the breast cancer report.

Among the high-profile launches at this week\u2019s Mobile World Congress, a security firm disrupted the event with a smartphone built entirely around encryption. The Blackphone is an Android-based handset built by Spanish manufacturer GeeksPhone alongside security experts Silent Circle and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).

Almost follow-proof: The Blackphone is an Android-based handset built by Spanish manufacturer GeeksPhone alongside security experts Silent Circle and Pretty Good Privacy . Internet access on the phone is carried out through a virtual private network (VPN) that sends and receives data in a way that\u2019s designed to keep it hidden. When the phone boots up it asks for a password and PIN before a wizard guides users through the security options. For example, it shows users which apps want access to which data. The BlackPhone owner can then decide to restrict access to that information and handpick the apps and the data they share. Mike Kershaw, chief architect from Blackphone told MailOnline the smartphone was designed to have \u2018the benefit of security without having to have an in-depth knowledge of how to make a phone secure.\u2019 The company says that it is 'anti-personal data from the ground up'. They say the phone will appeal will appeal to those who don't want any data collection, those who agree with principle of collecting data and businessmen . Kershaw continued that there are existing products, such as Red Phone, that lets customers communicate securely to each other, but \u2018Blackphone extends this concept to everyone.\u2019 \u2018We're anti-personal data from the ground up. 'There are a number of people this handset will appeal to; there's the people who don't want any data collection. 'There are people concerned about data collection for data collection sake. 'Then there are people concerned about secondary data collection, such as business men who want to communicate securely while travelling - they want to be as anonymous as they want to be. \u2018Today, once data is collected somewhere it's only a subpoena away for the authorities. We explicitly don't collect data and it's architected so it can't fulfil subpoenas.\u2019 The encryption on the Blackphone extends to voice calls, video calls, voicemail, texting, file transfer and storage, web browsing and apps. This encryption is done via the Silent Circle and SpiderOak privacy and security software. Subscriptions are included for two years with the Blackphone, and they can then be renewed.Alternatively, customers can upgrade to the next-generation Blackphone handset. The phone costs $629 (\u00a3376) plus delivery. Blackphone claims the price for all the individual services totals $1508 (\u00a3903). The mobile has a 4.7-inch HD IPS display, although the precise resolution is yet to be announced. It also comes with a a 2GHz quad-core processor, 16GB of storage, an 8-megapixel camera and 4G.

When asked to address these concerns, Blackphone\u2019s managing director, Toby Weir-Jones told MailOnline: \u2018The availability of a tool does not create the intent for mischief. 'If you\u2019re a bad guy, the fact [Blackphone] is making cryptography usable doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to take that a step further; you're not going to become bad because of that knowledge either.\u2019 Samsung is the latest firm to launch a phone with a fingerprint scanner to improve security on its new Galaxy S5, following Apple\u2019s lead last year. Weir-Jones said that Apple made biometrics fashionable, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best way to protect your data. \u2018We have plans for a whole family of Blackphones and we'll see which security measures, such as biometrics, have legs and which are legitimate. We want to introduce something people can use, that\u2019s easy, simple and familiar.\u2019 Kershaw added that the company decided to run the PrivatOS on top of Android because it means users can install any Android app, and Blackphone will support private features with it. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, told MailOnline that the revelations that we are increasingly being tracked online, it was only a matter of time before companies started to promote themselves as being privacy friendly. 'Everyone from lawyers to people with sensitive illnesses are concerned about how safe their information is on their devices, so technology that enables both security and privacy will undoubtedly be popular,' he said. 'The longer the legal framework around surveillance fails to reflect the modern world, the more people will rely on technology to protect their privacy. 'It is clear that previously trusted systems are far less secure than we thought, as encryption has been undermined and private companies secretly compelled to turn over information in bulk on users, so this phone is the first step to restoring the balance where people\u2019s data is not collected unless they are under suspicion.'",

Do people dislike her because she's too ''sexy''? Is her apocryphal backstory -- the supposed millionaire father, the alleged lip augmentations (which she denies), the name change from the more benign Lizzy Grant -- the issue? Or is it just because she's scored a deluge of prerelease hype that, as her widely panned January 14 appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" showed, might not be deserved? \"Born to Die's\" wild swings between unqualified stunners and bizarre miscues provide no real answers, but they do produce plenty more chum for the message-board sharks. The stormy ''Dark Paradise'' and industrial-cabaret shimmy ''Million Dollar Man'' are both knockouts; like the best episodes of \"Twin Peaks,\" they're dark, lovely, and just a little bit corny.

They had been due to take part in U.S. Central Command's Regional Cooperation exercise, which is held every year to foster better cooperation and military readiness between participating countries. The men, who were cleared by the US State Department to participate, had been free to 'come and go' when they weren't taking part in exercises, and on Saturday, they had a free day.

The Beaverton, Oregon, girl, who is now 18 years old, only found out about the outrageous violation of her privacy six months ago when he mother discovered a tiny camera stashed under a heap of papers in her bedroom. On Tuesday, 48-year-old-old Bradley McCollum, a one-time friend of the Reed family, pleaded guilty in Washington County circuit court to charges of burglary and invasion of personal privacy - both misdemeanors. Scroll down for video . Peeping Tom:\u00a0Bradley McCollum, 48 (left), has pleaded guilty to charges of burglary and invasion of personal privacy - both misdemeanors - for videotaping his friend's young daughter, Madison Reed (right), for four years . Shocking find: In August, Madison's mother discovered a small camera hidden under some papers in her daughter's bedroom (pictured) As part of a plea deal, he is expected to be sentenced March 10 to two years in prison - a decision the victim and her parents have decried as a 'slap on the wrist.' Prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to prove he was guilty of a sex crime, which means that upon his release McCollum will not be required to register as a sex offender. Speaking to KGW this week, Madison and her parents said McCollum is getting off too easy considering the heinousness of the crime, and all because under state law recording a minor with a hidden camera is not a felony. \u2018It doesn't make sense at all because I don't know why it's not child pornography,\u2019 Madison said. \u2018I was underage at the time and the intent of what he did was so obvious. 'Slap on the wrist':\u00a0As part of a plea deal, McCollum is expected to be sentenced March 10 to two years in prison, and he will not be required to register as a sex offender . A police investigation has revealed that in 2010, Bradley McCollum, a close friend and neighbor of the Reeds, planted a camera at his beach house to spy on Madison whenever the family visited him. Last July, McCollum slipped a second recording device into Madison's bedroom, taping hours of footage showing the teenage girl naked and in various state of undress. About two weeks later, Madison's father, Clark Reed, became alarmed when he spotted his friend near his daughter's room, and a short time later his wife came upon a camera smaller than a smartphone hidden under some papers on a dresser. Madison, who is now 18, says it has been difficult for her to get over the trauma, and to this day she cannot shake off the feeling that she is being watched. 'I don't like to think about it, but I think about it all the time. Like all day,' Miss Reed told the station, adding that in order to put her mind at ease her parents had taped the blinds in her room to the wall. Madison and her father, Clark Reed (right), said McCollum is getting off too easy because under state law, recording a minor with a hidden camera is not a felony . The Reed family are now pushing for state lawmakers to pass legislation that would upgrade hidden camera crimes to sexual offenses with stiffer penalties. Former Oregon state Representative Denyc Boles, a Republican from Salem, has proposed a bill that would make the charge of invasion of personal privacy an automatic felony if the victim is under 18 years and carry a maximum penalty of five years and prison. Boles' bill would also require people convicted of felony invasion of personal privacy to register as sex offenders if they have a prior sex crime conviction.",

Apple has scored a significant victory in its copyright battle with Samsung after a German court yesterday barred the Korean firm from selling its flagship Galaxy tablet in most of Europe. The court order comes a week after Samsung was forced to delay the Australian launch of its latest Galaxy tablet because of a separate lawsuit alleging Samsung infringed on a number of Apple's patents. Apple has said Samsung's Galaxy line of mobile phones and tablets 'slavishly' copied the iPhone and iPad. It has sued in the U.S., Australia and elsewhere. Tablet war: Samsung has temporarily been banned from selling its flagship Galaxy device in Europe after Apple took legal action accusing the Korean firm of 'slavishly copying' the iPad (pictured) Galaxy Tab: Samsung Germany said it would file an objection immediately . Samsung, whose tablets use Google's Android software, has counter-sued Apple. Lee Seung-Woo,  an analyst at Shinyoung Securities in Seoul, said: 'There's no doubt the court decision will have an adverse effect on Samsung. 'Samsung is clashing with Apple in . many places, which could result in a temporary fall in sales and . increase costs related to litigation.' Apple confirmed that a district court . in the German city of Dusseldorf granted the preliminary injunction . against the Galaxy Tab 10.1. Adam Howorth, a spokesman for Apple, said: 'It's . no coincidence that Samsung's latest products look a lot like the . iPhone and iPad, from the shape of the hardware to the user interface . and even the packaging. 'This kind of blatant copying is wrong, and we need to protect Apple's intellectual property when companies steal our ideas.' Apple is one participant in a web of litigation among phone makers and software firms over who owns patents used in smartphones, as rivals aggressively rush into the smartphone and tablet market. Complicating things between Apple and Samsung is the pair's $5billion-plus commercial relationship, which some analysts think might be at risk. Samsung, for instance, counts Apple as its biggest customer, making chips and other parts central to Apple's mobile devices. The well-reviewed Galaxy Tab 10.1 was only recently launched in Europe and is in the early stages of being rolled out. For now, the iPad is the market leader. Competing products including Research In Motion's PlayBook and Motorola's Xoom have received lukewarm reviews, while Hewlett Packard's TouchPad is a late entrant in the market, which already has more than 100 devices, mostly running on Android. Meanwhile, a U.S. trade agency is also set to review Apple's patent-infringement complaint against Taiwanese phone market HTC Corp. The ban applies throughout the European Union, except the Netherlands, where a Hague-based court said separate hearings were scheduled for today and tomorrow. Apple would not say why it filed a separate case in the Netherlands. 'It's a strategy Apple has adopted to completely prevent Samsung from putting its tablet into the market place,' said Nathan Mattock, an intellectual property lawyer at Marque Lawyers in Sydney. Samsung's mobile unit, which includes handsets and tablet PCs, generated 30 per cent of the technology giant's revenue in the second quarter. The bulk of the rest comes from memory chips and televisions, sectors where Samsung is the global leader. Samsung, the world's biggest technology company by revenues, said it would challenge the court decision. In a statement, the firm said: 'The request for an injunction was filed with no notice to Samsung, and the order was issued without any hearing or presentation of evidence from Samsung.' 'I think we will be rigorously defending our position,' said Samsung executive Younghee Lee. Lee, who was unveiling the Galaxy Tab in India on Wednesday, said Samsung would launch the Tab in Australia in September. In a statement, Samsung Germany said it would file an objection immediately. 'Samsung will protect its intellectual property in Germany with legal measures. We will also actively continue to defend our rights worldwide.' Apple's move raises the stakes for .

Just three years ago, Zahia Dehar was thrown into the spotlight as the underage escort at the centre of a scandal involving France's star footballers. Now the Algerian beauty has become a fashion muse to top designers including Karl Lagerfield, regularly treading the catwalk in high-profile shows and making front covers of glossy magazines. Miss Dehar, now 20, has used the scandal to catapult herself to fame, while Bayern Munich player Franck Ribery is facing jail and a hefty fine for spending \u00a35,000 flying her from Paris to a five-star German hotel for sex as a 'birthday present' to himself.

Two other players were also said to have paid \u00a31,500-a-night to sleep with the young call girl, although they all claimed to have believed she was 18 - the legal age for prositution in France. Just months after having sex with the married father of two,\u00a0 who is worth \u00a340million, Miss Dehar got an agent and began being photographed for Italian publications V magazine and Vanity Fair Italy as well as popular French magazines. Smitten Chanel designer Lagerfeld described her as the idealised vision of a French courtesan and even photographed her debut look book himself. 'She is fascinating,' he said.

Although the charges against Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, 22, and Lyon's Sidney Govou, 30, have never been proven, the three men may never live down the disgrace of their alleged indiscretion. For Miss Dehar, on the other hand, the shocking story has lifted her from underage call girl working at a French brothel to international stardom. She moved to France from Algeria when she was 10 and grew up on a crime-ridden housing estate in the Paris suburbs with her mother and two brothers. Her father walked out on the family when she was 14 and she began bunking off school, meeting wealthy men in expensive bars along the Champs-Elysees. She told Paris Match at the time of the scandal that she turned to prostitution shortly after her 16th birthday. 'The first time I did it was also to celebrate a man's birthday,' she said. 'I've always looked older than I am, and when I began to understand that I was pleasing to men, I thought: \"Why not take advantage of it?\" 'I asked for 2,000 \u00adeuros a night or just 500 euros for what I called a brief moment of pleasure.

No one forces me to do anything and when I don't want to do something, I don't. 'I consider myself to be a call-girl, but not a prostitute.' In 2010, she was one of 18 girls questioned in a police raid on Paris brothel Cafe Zaman, used by some of France's best footballers, in a scandal that threatened to engulf the country's World Cup campaign. She said Ribery had hired her for a single night on his 26th birthday, but did not know she was underage, and she refused to give evidence at his trial. 'Franck approached me in a Paris club,' she said. 'He made reservations at a luxury hotel in Munich. We had sex and he paid me. I was a lovely little present, wasn't I?' Veteran French actress Isabell Adjani is now planning to make a documentary about her rags-to-riches life story.

The case drew national attention when Rep. Judy Chu of California, the aunt of the Marine who killed himself, told a congressional committee about it in September. A Marine statement sent to CNN Thursday said the commanding general of the 3rd Marine Division, Brig. Gen. Frederick Padilla, had referred charges in the case against Sgt. Benjamin E. Johns, Lance Cpl. Jacob D. Jacoby, and Lance Cpl. Carlos Orozco III to a general court martial. The three allegedly berated and assaulted Lance Cpl. Harry Lew for falling asleep while on watch when he first arrived in Afghanistan, according to Chu and a Marine investigation of the incident reported by the Marine Corps Times. Lew committed suicide by shooting himself shortly thereafter. \"Harry's death was a heartbreaking tragedy that could have been prevented,\" Chu said Thursday in statement issued by her office. \"The decision by the Marines Corps to bring the three Marines before a jury of their peers brings comfort to the family and shows the military justice system at work.\" In her September appearance at a House Armed Services Committee hearing, Chu said her nephew's sergeant told fellow Marines in the unit to \"teach\" the 21-year-old newcomer after he was found asleep on his watch. \"Lance Corporal Lew was beaten, berated and forced to perform rigorous exercise,\" she said then. \"He was forced to do push-ups and leg lifts wearing full body armor, and sand was poured in his mouth. He was forced to dig a hole for hours. He was kicked, punched and stomped on. And it did not stop until 3:20 a.m.\" Minutes later, she said, Lew \"climbed into the foxhole that he just dug and shot himself and committed suicide.\" A military investigation report obtained by the Marine Corps Times said Lew killed himself with a two- or three-round burst from an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon in the early hours of April 3. According to the Marine Corps Times story on the report, a message found on Lew's arm, believed to be a suicide note, said: \"May hate me now, but in the long run this was the right choice I'm sorry my mom deserves the truth.\" The incident at Patrol Base Gowragi, in Nawa district, began with Lew failing to respond to radio calls late on the night of April 2, the report said. A sergeant who found him sleeping told others that \"peers should correct peers,\" it said, as reported by the Marine Corps Times. The report detailed how two lance corporals, whose names were redacted, berated Lew and ordered him to do exercises in body armor for four hours, with one of them stomping on Lew's legs at times. One Marine kicked and punched Lew until being stopped by another, the report said. Less than an hour later, it said, Lew killed himself. \"At 0343 on 3 April 2011, while crouching down in the fighting position he had just dug, LCpl Lew leaned over his M249 Squad Automatic Weapon as it pointed to the sky, placed the muzzle in his mouth, pulled the trigger, and intentionally killed himself,\" the report said, according to the Marine Corps Times.

Fans promptly lost it and the Internet was on the verge of exploding. Even fellow celebs seemed to have been left breathless. Singer Katy Perry tweeted, \"Don't talk to me today unless it's about @Beyonce THANX.\" Added actress Abigail Breslin, \"The new Beyonce album is so perfect wow.\" The 14-track self-titled album was released exclusively on iTunes at midnight and had to be purchased in its totality. Singles will not be available for purchase until December 20. In addition to the songs, there are also 17 music videos. Speaking to fans via a video on her official Facebook page, Beyonce called the project a \"visual album\" and said \"I see music.\" \"It's more than just what I hear,\" she said. \"When I'm connected to something, I immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or an emotion, a memory from my childhood, thoughts about life, my dreams or my fantasies. And they're all connected to the music.\" Her fifth studio album has been eagerly awaited since the success of \"4,\" which was released in 2011. Over the past year she has hinted that something new was in the works and previewed singles including \"Grown Woman,\" \"Bow Down/I Been On\" and \"Standing on the Sun,\" which served as the soundtrack for her H&M fashion campaign. The new album - which quickly shot to No. 1 on iTunes Friday - features collaborations with rapper Drake, singer Frank Ocean and author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and, of course, her husband, rapper Jay Z. Daughter Blue Ivy also makes a cameo. The bold and innovative move was hailed by critics and fans. USA Today 's Korina Lopez wrote \"It's a fully baked album, no filler remixes and re-released greatest hits. By sidestepping promotional blitz and gimmicks, this album could be her most personal yet.\" According to Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times, Beyonce, her producers and writers began work on the project last summer while they were all together in the Hamptons. The end result, Kennedy said, \"is a striking collection of work that shows her torching the veil of her carefully crafted image.\" \"Songs on the album jump and dive between genres and are woven together with everything from spoken word and trap raps to the coos of her daughter Blue Ivy and vintage Destiny's Child footage,\" Kennedy wrote. \"It's a lot to consume, but a revelatory look at the singer who has tirelessly calculated what she chooses to share (and it's not always much).\" Miles Marshall Lewis, the Arts & Culture editor for Ebony.com, writes that Beyonce has overshadowed some other big-name singers who have recently released new projects. \"Where pop stars are concerned, Beyonc\u00e9 easily bests the latest from both Lady Gaga and Britney Spears, rivaling Justin Timberlake with a fraction of the media blitz (so far),\" Lewis said. \"Now that's a superpower.\" For her part, Beyonce said in her video to fans that she was inspired by the legendary Michael Jackson. \"I remember watching 'Thriller' on TV with my family. It was an event, we all sat around the TV and now looking back, I am so happy I was born around that time,\" she said. \"I miss that immersive experience.\"",

Supporters and opponents of gay marriage clashed yesterday as lawmakers prepared to vote on making New York the biggest state to legalize same-sex marriage. The measure to make gay marriage legal, introduced by Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat and strong advocate, needs just one more vote before it can pass into the state Senate. The state Assembly approved the bill by a wide margin last week, and Monday is the last day of the legislative session before summer recess. Equality: Supporters of gay marriage hold up colourful signs in New York's Central Park on Saturday as they urge lawmakers to back a same-sex marriage bill . Thirty-one senators, including two Republicans, are currently in favor of the bill. Its backers need one more member to back it for it to pass. New York's Archbishop, Timothy Dolan, reiterated his and the Catholic Church's opposition to gay marriage on Sunday, vowing to oppose 'any radical bill to redefine the very essence of marriage.' 'One has to wonder why the proponents of this radical redefinition, who claim overwhelming popular support, would not consider (a referendum) on such a drastic departure from traditional values?' he wrote on his blog. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has become a prominent champion of legalized gay marriage, pushing his state into the centre of the national debate over an emotional and divisive issue. In the past week, the Democrat has personally lobbied wavering Republican lawmakers and has said the extension of marriage rights to gays and lesbians is 'a matter of principle, not politics.' Historic: Hillary, left, and Julie Goodridge are married by Rev. William Sinkford in Boston during first day of state-sanctioned gay marriage in U.S. May 17, 2004 . 'This state has a proud tradition and a proud legacy as the progressive capital of the nation,' he said last Friday. 'We led the way, and it's time for New York to lead the way once again.' The effort carries some political peril but could be potentially rewarding, given evolving public sentiment on gay rights in New York and the nation. 'It looks like a profile in courage, and maybe it is,' said Larry Sabato, director of the Centre for Politics at the University of Virginia. 'But it also may be politically smart in the long run.' Mr Cuomo's support for gay rights is already known to voters in New York, which would become the sixth state to legalise the issue . His efforts this past week to get the bill through the Republican-controlled state Senate - the lone roadblock to passage - make good on an issue he ran on last year. During that campaign, he took his daughters to a gay pride parade in New York City, drawing sharp criticism from his Republican opponent. 'The governor is putting skin in the game and has a steadfast commitment to the issue,' said Kevin Nix of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights group. 'That he's made marriage equality a priority for this legislative session speaks volumes about his commitment.' As a purely political matter, advocating . for gay marriage makes sense for Democrats in a state like New York, . where gay groups are players in party politics. Mr Cuomo's lobbying, coming . after he pushed through a fiscally conservative budget, also could . burnish his image among liberals. Support: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has been a driving force behind the same-sex marriage bill which is opposed by Archbishop Timothy Dolan (right) Mr Cuomo is an astute politician who was a key player in his father's campaigns for New York governor three decades ago, then was schooled in President Bill Clinton's Cabinet, where he served as Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary. The lessons learned from both are at play during this debate - the lofty, inclusive idealism of his father matched by Clinton's practical politics. He is opposed, though, by some conservative groups and religious leaders. Archbishop\u00a0 Dolan likened the effort to 'redefine' marriage to something that would be done in China or North Korea. The U.S. federal government does not recognize same-sex marriage, but five individual states do: . Connecticut . Iowa . Massachusetts . New Hampshire . Vermont . (Plus Washington, D.C. and the Coquille Indian Tribe in Oregon) States that recognize same-sex marriage but do not grant same-sex marriage licenses: . New York . Rhode Island . Maryland . Same-sex marriages were legal in California from June 16, 2008 to November 4, 2008, when Proposition 8 passed to prohibit the practice. As of March 2011, 41 states prohibit same-sex marriage via laws or state constitution . A Gallup poll last month found national support for same-sex marriage . going up nine points from the previous year to 53 per cent (support was . at 27 per cent in 1996). Support is highest among young people. Still, polls this year have shown that more than half of voters in New York support gay marriage, with backing heaviest among Democrats. Mr Cuomo's position is also in line with New York's last two governors and its two Democratic U.S. senators. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has been a high-profile advocate of gay rights issues, and Sen. Charles Schumer came out in support of gay marriage in 2009. In fact, the reason mr Cuomo can push for gay marriage is that he holds office in a relatively liberal state. Nationwide, governors supporting same-sex marriage appear to be in the minority. Among them are Democrats Deval Patrick in neighbouring Massachusetts and Jerry Brown in California. Mr Cuomo, less than six months in office, has not said publicly that he wants to run for national office. But his ambition, record of success and relatively young age at 53, raises the question of whether his stance on gay marriage hurt him if he aspires to be president. Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, said the strong opposition to gay marriage around the country is proven by the 30 states with constitutional language defining marriage as between a man and a woman. 'We never lost a public vote on marriage in any state,' he said. A Gallup poll last month found national support for same-sex marriage going up nine points from the previous year to 53 per cent (support was at 27 per cent in 1996). Support is highest among younger people, a major reason why many analysts believe the trend will continue. Mr Sabato said that could make Mr Cuomo's issue a winner for him in the coming years, particularly since many Democratic constituencies who will choose the party's nominee favour same-sex marriage. 'The earliest he could run is 2016,' Mr Sabato said. 'And I think his gamble is that the country is evolving on this issue and moving in New York's direction.' Mr Cuomo has actually shifted on the issue himself, at least in public. He favoured civil unions for same-sex partners during his first, aborted run for New York governor in 2002. At that time, Vermont allowed civil unions. No states would have legal same-sex marriage until Massachusetts in 2004. By the time he ran for attorney general in 2006, he was using the words 'gay marriage.' And he won the race easily. The New York Times had quoted Mr Cuomo as saying he had supported gay marriage in his heart during the 2002 campaign, but didn't make it an issue because the political focus then was on civil unions.",

Fraudsters allgedly posted fake adverts for work at Harrods on a website as part of a \u00a31 million scam to trick desperate job hunters of their savings, a court heard today. The Nigerian gang recruited a British computer whizzkid Tyrone Ellis to write 'Trojan' malware which were hidden in job application pack downloads posted on the free website Gumtree. Once embedded on computers, the software copied bank log on and security details of those seeking work before forwarding them on to the gang, the court was told. Outside the Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, established in 1834 it has become an international symbol of all things British . The gang would then empty the accounts taking everything they had, which in some cases amounted to just \u00a3400 and in other cases \u00a34,700, the Old Bailey said. 'Mules' were then hired to go to banks and withdraw the cash or the gang would go on an online shopping spree, it was heard. The fraud was uncovered when job seekers complained to Harrods that their computers had become infected when they downloaded an application form, the court heard. The store\u2019s director of security Gregory Faulkener then responded to an advert, downloaded and quarantined the application pack and called in American 'phishing' experts. Finding the malware, he then contacted Scotland Yard\u2019s economic crime unit while sending an e-mail warning the gang to stop using Harrods name. Undeterred the gang continued to post over 415 further fake job adverts for other jobs such as a \u00a325,000 sales assistant with Securestore. Tracing the unique IP addresses used to post the jobs free online with Gumtree, police raided homes connected to the gang over nine months after the first fake job adverts were posted in late August 2010. But only in 2012 were the whole gang be rounded up - from the number of emails, accounts and texts it is estimated they scammed their victims out of 'in excess of \u00a31 million.' The jury at the Old Bailey heard that the gang made 'in excess of \u00a31million' from the scam . Walton Hornsby, prosecuting, told the jury the gang themselves even referred to the scam as the 'Gumtree fraud.' He said: 'It specifically targeted people looking for jobs. 'A decision was made someone applying for a job is perhaps more keen to cooperate and comply with any instructions given by someone that seems to be positively responding to their application by inviting them to download an application pack. 'In August and early September 2010 a number of adverts appeared on Gumtree advertising various jobs at Harrods, a rather attractive post you may think.' Those responding were in return then sent an e-mail pretending to be from the respected Blue Arrow recruitment agency inviting them 'to fill in that application pack for further consideration.' Mr Hornsby said: 'Although a number of persons had doubts about downloading an application pack, many did so. Almost immediately there started to appear to be problems with their computers. 'What in fact happened that application pack was no application pack at all. 'It was a virus that had been specifically programmed to be released onto the computers once you have clicked on that application and downloaded it.' Once embedded the software waited until the user tried to access their online bank accounts. The unsuspecting user would then be redirected to fake sites 'which looked all the world that it was a genuine bank site they were trying to contact' before the gang\u2019s software stole log on details. However, he added: 'In late summer and early Autumn 2010 a number of individuals complained to Harrods that they had applied for job adverts and downloaded an application pack and a virus was released onto their computer.' The court heard the suspected fraudsters were originally from Nigeria and were close friends all living in south London and all were studying or had studied IT. Gumtree: The free advertising website where people were tricked into applying for attractive jobs at Harrods by downloading software which then corrupted their computers and stole their security details . It is alleged the malware was mainly written by whizz kid Ellis, 27, with the help of brothers Southampton Solent University graduate Ajibola Akinlabi, 26; Portsmouth University graduate Babatunde Akinlabi, 28; Damilare Oduwole, 26; and Olalekan Awosile, 27. The five plus Awosile\u2019s 48-year-old care worker mother Folasade Balogun, whose internet connection was used to post some of the job adverts, deny conspiracy to defraud. Ellis denies developing second generation phishing programmes for mobile smart phones and paypal when arrested.

England play Samoa on Friday in Marcoussis, Spain on August 5 before the duel with Canada on August 9. Alphonsi has received numerous personal awards in her distinguished career, which has seen her claim seven successive Six Nations titles, six in Grand Slams, but a World Cup honour has proved elusive. Ambitious: Maggie Alphonsi is aiming for the trophy when England's women begin their World Cup campaign . New Zealand have won the last three tournaments by beating England in the final, something England will hope to put right on August 17 at Jean Bouin Stadium in Paris. Alphonsi, who is playing in her third World Cup, said: 'I've been very fortunate to have got the accolades that I have and all the recognition, which is brilliant. 'But the real reason why I wanted to get into the sport and play for England was to be world champion. It would mean the world. 'That's one accolade I haven't got. That's what I want for the team, as well as an individual thing.\"I want people to recognise us as the best team in the world.' The hurt of 2010 has driven Alphonsi and the other 11 survivors from the defeat in London on. 'Losing in that World Cup was horrendous,' added the flanker, who recalled a team meeting the following January when head coach Gary Street questioned whether his players were willing to commit to four more years. 'To face it again and say 'right, do you want to commit to another four years to get that medal?' Everyone said 'yes'. 'I remember it well. It was a hard time, but if anything it's been good for us the last four years because it's kept us going. More to come: Alphonsi, pictured here in action against Ireland during the Six Nations, will be competing in her third World Cup next month . 'It's like Olympic gold. It's one of the things that drives you to get up in the morning and work really hard and train hard.' Alphonsi . believes the World Cups have got bigger and better every edition since . 2002 and, coupled with sevens' inclusion in the Olympics, the sport is . only getting better. She is not yet ready to think about playing at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, with the World Cup the full focus. 'The priority right now is this World Cup and doing really well,' she added. 'All I can think about at the moment is this and once August 17 rolls around, after that I can decide what I want to do. 'I've been to one Sevens Rugby World Cup and it was absolutely amazing. 'To go to an Olympics would be anyone's dream. Who knows? There's a lot of good players coming through and I'm not getting any younger.' History: Alphonsi and England suffered defeat against New Zealand in the last World Cup final . Prop Rochelle 'Rocky' Clark is the most-capped player in the squad with 91 appearances. 'Short for Rochelle is Rocky and I got my first cap out in Canada where the Rockies are. It's quite apt really,' Clark said. Clark hopes for 'third time lucky' in 2014. 'We were really close in 2010 and it could've gone either way,' she added. 'That disappointment makes me even more hungry to win this one. I've got four years more experience to take into it.' Clark is often compared to Jason Leonard for her longevity. She added: 'The first goal is to win the World Cup, then the second goal will be to get 100 caps. When we come into next season and the Six Nations I'll think about that.'",

The gunman, who said he was with al Qaeda, took four people hostage at a bank five hours earlier, police said. He released one of them, a woman, after about three hours, Crepin said, and a second hostage was released about an hour after that. The incident ended after the man emerged from the bank with a hostage and attempted to shoot police officers, Crepin said. A hostage negotiator had earlier spoken to the gunman by phone, Crepin said. Described as a man in his 20s or 30s from France's Haute-Garonne region, the gunman was \"very, very agitated\" during the talks, he said. Authorities have not officially identified the hostage-taker, security police spokesman Frederic Tamisier said. He said the two remaining hostages were freed after the shootout, in which the gunman was \"not badly\" injured. Toulouse prosecutor Michel Valet said the gunman fired two shots as the action began. He said the four hostages are all safe and sound. The hostage-taker is in a Toulouse hospital, he said, but not in a critical condition. He has two injuries -- one in the left hand and the other in the right thigh -- which, Valet said, indicate that police sought to neutralize him to protect the hostages, rather than trying to kill him. The hostage-taker was armed with a pistol that usually fires rubber bullets but can be converted to fire lethal rounds, Valet said. No more shots were fired from either side once the hostages were secured, he added. \"We can consider that things have ended rather well, no police officers injured, that the four hostages are not injured either, and that the hostage-taker, while he may be injured, his life is apparently not in danger,\" he said. Valet said the man suffers from \"psychological troubles, and his acts are linked to these claims which are badly defined, badly expressed. At this hour, it is difficult to know exactly what is driving his behavior, (which is) everything but rational.\" President Francois Hollande hailed the professionalism shown by the police in bringing the situation to a close. \"I rejoice that all the hostages were liberated, safe and sound, and that the hostage-taker was captured,\" he said in a written statement. The incident happened several hundred yards from the scene of a standoff between police and a gunman earlier this year that ended with the gunman dead. In March, police cornered Mohammed Merah, who was wanted in the killing of seven people. He was killed March 22 by police after the 32-hour siege of a Toulouse apartment. Crepin said Wednesday's hostage-taking was an armed robbery that went wrong. The hostages were the director of the bank and three employees, he said. Valet's office was in charge of the situation, he said. Photographer Jenet Gautier, who lives near the bank, said the neighborhood was calm during the incident and the situation was not comparable to the Merah siege. A high school in the area was evacuated, staff there said. Investigations shed new light on Toulouse terrorist shootings . A local real estate agent told CNN that police told her to stay inside and keep her doors locked. Marie Cluzaud, 28, said she was scared but didn't hear any noise connected to the hostage-taking. Streets were blocked off, she said. In the March standoff, Merah was wanted for the killings of three French paratroopers, a rabbi and three Jewish children ages 4, 5, and 7. Two other people were seriously wounded in shootings blamed on him. CNN's Stephanie Halasz, Saskya Vandoorne, Dheepthi Namasivayam, Ines de la Cuetara and Alex Felton contributed to this report.",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\n(CNN) -- Elon Musk wants to revolutionize transportation. Again. The serial entrepreneur envisions a future where mag-lev trains in enormous pneumatic tubes whisk us from Los Angeles to New York in 45 minutes. Need to be in Beijing tomorrow? No problem. It's a two-hour ride away. As crazy as it sounds, Musk is merely updating an idea that's been around since the early 1900s, and at least one company is working on a functional prototype. But according to Wired sources, his involvement won't be nearly as hands-on as Musk's other endeavors at Tesla Motors and SpaceX. The engineering behind the Hyperloop is similar to the old-school pneumatic tube systems used by banks to suck your deposit to the teller at the drive-through. But naturally, it's more complicated than that. A massive vacuum tube \u2014 mounted either above ground or even under water \u2014 would be combined with a magnetic levitation system used on conventional bullet trains. That means no friction, no wind resistance, no chance of collisions, and insanely high speeds. Musk described the Hyperloop as \"a cross between a Concorde, a railgun and an air hockey table,\" at AllThingsD's D11 conference earlier this year. And in an interview with PandoDaily, Musk said the Hyperloop could form a fifth tent pole of modern transportation, joining cars, planes, trains, and boats, adding that because of its low energy usage and ability to get juice from solar power, it could generate more power than it would consume. Elon Musk: Our future in space depends on reusable rockets . But up until now, he hasn't elaborated on his involvement. Musk's interest in the idea was sparked after researching California's new high-speed rail project and realizing that it will be the slowest and \u2014 at $70 billion \u2014 the most expensive system on the planet. To his mind, there's a better solution. The Hyperloop is it. And one firm unaffiliated with Musk is in the early stages of development. ET3, a company based in Longmont, Colorado, is working on a Evacuated Tube Transport (ETT) system, which it describes as \"space travel on Earth.\" It uses two tubes \u2014 one for each direction \u2014 with 400-pound, passenger car-sized capsules that could house six people, each accelerated by linear electric motors. According to ET3, state trips would average speeds of around 370 mph, while international trips would hit that insane 4,000 mph mark. The company, which calls itself an \"open consortium,\" claims that it's working with partners in China and has sold nearly 100 licenses for the technology. But ET3\u2032s claims pose more questions than answers, particularly when considering you can buy your own license for the bargain basement price of $100. But the idea for a vacuum-sealed high-speed transit system isn't anything new. The \"vactrain\" concept was floated in the early 1910s and a paper written by physicist R.M. Salter and published by the Rand Corporation in 1972 titled the \"Very High Speed Transit System,\" or VHST, describes something very similar to what ET3 is developing. But where Musk fits in remains a question. Sources close to the Tesla co-founder and CEO say he believes ET3 is on the right track, but is missing some key components, and that Musk has his hands full with Tesla and SpaceX, and would rather have some involvement in the development, with another entity taking the helm. That lines up with a few responses Musk made on Twitter when asked about patenting the technology. \"I really hate patents unless critical to company survival,\" Musk tweeted. \"Will publish Hyperloop as open source.\" When asked about partners, Musk said he's \"happy to work with the right partners. Must truly share philosophical goal of breakthrough tech done fast & w/o wasting money on BS.\" We'll have to wait until August 12th to find out more.

John Resetar, who is employed by\u00a0Capital Asset Protection Inc., a Pittsburgh-area company contracted to provide security to the Franklin Regional School District, got the shock of his life on August 4 when he found out his job was being terminated and his services were no longer needed this school year. Resetar got the news in a letter from Jeffrey Dahlke, Capital Asset's regional security operations manager, which read: 'Franklin Regional and Capital came to the conclusion that ... it is best ... to relieve you of your duties at the school.' Scroll down for video . John Resetar (pictured) was stabbed in the chest while holding down a teen on a schoolwide slashing spree . 'What really upset me, more than anything,' Resetar told KDKA, 'is that nobody would sit down and talk to me and tell me to my face. You know, I had to get a letter that was three weeks before school.' 'The way I was let go, I didn\u2019t think it was fair, for what I did for the school.' Tim Dawson, Resetar's lawyer, says they plan to file a lawsuit. Despite what the letter states, the school district said Resetar's termination was unexpected. 'We had communication with the company and are trying to get more information, but it wasn't really in our realm of control,' said Mary Katherine Reljac, an assistant superintendent with the district. She said the school was surprised to be mentioned in the letter. Last April, Resetar became a national hero overnight when he helped to apprehend Alex Hribal at Franklin Regional High School after the teenage suspect allegedly stabbed 20 students with a pair of 8-inch kitchen knives. In the process, the unarmed guard was knifed in the chest. Alex Hribal, who allegedly stabbed 21 people, wrote a note boasting of his planned kill spree, investigators said . The entire attack unfolded in less than five minutes, as Hribal allegedly ran wildly down the school's hallway, slashing away with knives. 'He was stabbed on a Wednesday and he returned to work the following Monday, after having a stab wound an inch below his heart,' Resetar's lawyer Dawson said. 'He's a young 70, he was a linebacker and he can certainly still perform his job,' he added. Resetar worked in the school for nine years before he was told via certified mail that he was being dismissed. Now, the man who saved the lives of countless students, is unemployed. In June, Hribal, who is being tried as an adult, waived his right to a preliminary trial. His lawyer, Patrick Thomassey,\u00a0plans to ask a judge to move the case to juvenile court, where Hribal would face incarceration or probation only until he's 21. Capital Asset Protection has yet to comment.",

The secret of happiness may be to not expect too much from life. For if you start off with low expectations you could end up pleasantly surprised, according to a scientific study into human happiness. A stock image of a group of smiling friends is pictured . The \u2018ebb and flow\u2019 of mental happiness - the way our mood shifts moment-to-moment - is profoundly impacted by our expectations of life, they suggest. The researchers even created a formula for predicting happiness. Although the formula itself is complicated, put simply it looks at the event (t), how important or significant that event is to that person (w) and when the event occurred, also known as the 'forgetting factor'. The 'forgetting factor' in particular looks at what has happened in the past to determine the current expectations. EVj is the average reward from taking part in a certain event, and RPE is the reward compared to the expectation the person had beforehand. The researchers created a formula (pictured) for happiness. Although the formula is complicated, put simply it looks at the event (t), how important or significant the event is (w) and when the event occurred (y). EVj is the reward for taking part, and RPE is the reward compared to the expectation . Dr Robb Rutledge of University College London said his team were surprised to find just how important expectation is. He said: \u2018It is often said that you will be happier if your expectations are lower. \u2018We find that there is some truth to this - lower expectations make it more likely that an outcome will exceed those expectations and have a positive impact on happiness.\u2019 But his team of researchers, who tested their theory on 18,000 people, also discovered a converse force affects our mood. While low expectations can make us happy . if they are exceeded later, having high expectations to begin with make . us happy earlier. Scientists found that day-to-day wellbeing does not reflects whether things are going better than expected. They also discovered that expectations affect happiness before an outcome is certain. For instance, going to a friend's favourite restaurant (illustrated) with positive expectations can instantly lift someone's mood . Dr Rutledge said: \u2018Expectations also affect happiness even before we learn the outcome of a decision. \u2018If you have plans to meet a friend at your favourite restaurant, those positive expectations may increase your happiness as soon as you make the plan.\u2019 British . scientists found that day-to-day wellbeing does not reflect how well . things are going, but whether things are going better than expected. Lower expectations make it more likely that an outcome will exceed those expectations and have a positive impact on happiness. While . low expectations can make us happy if they are exceeded later, having . high expectations to begin with make us happy earlier, the found. Expectations also affect happiness even before we learn the outcome of a decision. His team combined the contrasting aspects of expectation and its impact on happiness and wrote it into an equation, which they discovered accurately predicted people\u2019s happiness. The equation accurately predicts how happy people will say they are based on recent events. The formula, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was put together by studying 26 people who completed a decision-making task in which their choices led to monetary gains and losses. They were repeatedly asked how happy they were, and their brain activity was measured using MRI scans. The scientists used the data to build a computer model, which was tested on 18,420 people using a smartphone app. The results confirmed that people who started off with lower expectations were happier when they had better results. The authors wrote: \u2018Conscious emotional feelings, such as momentary happiness, are core to the ebb and flow of human mental experience. \u2018Our computational model suggests momentary happiness is a state that reflects not how well things are going but instead whether things are going better than expected. \u2018This includes positive and negative expectations, even in the absence of outcomes.\u2019 A recent study found that the articiulation of vowels influence how we feel and that the most positive letter is 'i' while the most negative - and likely to make us feel sad or grumpy (stock image) is 'o' Researchers from Germany found the articulation of vowels influence how we feel. During tests, they tracked participants' emotions by measuring changes in facial muscles linked with smiling and frowning, and found the most positive letter is 'i\u2019 and the most negative is 'o'. The team, led by the Erfurt-based psychologist Professor Ralf Rummer, was able to demonstrate the articulation of vowels systematically influences our feelings and vice versa. The scientists focused on the sound of the long 'i' vowel and that of the long, closed 'o' vowel. In the first experiment, the researchers asked participants to watch film clips designed to put them in a positive or a negative mood, and then asked them to make up ten artificial words and to speak them out loud. They found the artificial words that contained significantly more i's than o's when the test subjects were in a positive mood. In a second experiment that looked at the link between the sounds, mood and people's facial muscles. They found that participants making the 'i' sounds found things funnier than those making 'o' noises. They believe that the tendency for 'i' sounds to occur in positively charged words, such as 'like', and for 'o' sounds to occur in negatively charged words, such as 'alone', in many languages appears to be linked to the corresponding use of facial muscles.",

It requires something special to shift the Welsh spotlight away from Gareth Bale, but on a night when the Real Madrid player did not quite produce his comic-book heroics, Crystal Palace's second choice staopper earned his nation a point with a performance that defied logic as much as the Bosnian attack on Friday night. Out from the Selhurst Park freezer, his string of saves very nearly got Wales all three.

Ashley Williams had an excellent chance too in the 78th minute, arriving unmarked onto Bale\u2019s free-kick six yards out only to head over. Hennessey provided that platform though, his best save of the night coming 10 minutes from the end. Miralem Pjanic hit his free-kick from 25 yards with dip and swerve but Hennessey threw his 6ft 6in frame into the air, reached up a glove, and diverted the ball wide. It was as thrilling as goalless draws come, and sees Wales top Group B in qualifying for Euro 2016. This was the most eagerly anticipated home international in years and it showed in the roads around Cardiff. Heavy traffic meant the stadium bore plenty of empty seats at kick-off. Eventually the projected 30,741 crowd assembled to mark the biggest since England visited the Millenium in March 2011. They had come hoping to see Wales make a statement of their intentions in this qualifying campaign; they had come wanting Bale to do the business again. In the seventh minute, he should have. Joe Ledley fed the ball to Chris Gunter on the right wing and the Reading player immediately saw Bale had somehow been granted more space in the Bosnia area than he might expect walking atop Mount Snowdon. A swift cross followed but, from inside the six-yard box, Bale fluffed his lines and missed the ball. Defender Toni Sunjic leapt to divert it for a corner. It was a promising start nevertheless. Bale had another opportunity when Ben Davies sent a high pass forward but world\u2019s most expensive left boot only managed to send a lofted volley wide.

Gradually, though, with Everton\u2019s Muhamed Besic doing an excellent job marking Bale, Bosnia gained increasing possession. Pjanic, so effective for Roma at Manchester City in the Champions League, was at the heart of most it. He had already seen a deflected shot from range test Hennessey before he fired an effort just wide in the 27th minute.

His second save from Medunjanin, as Wales groaned under the pressure, was just as impressive. He pushed the Bosnian\u2019s shot from range far away from the three lurking attackers. The intensity of the evening was laid bare when a mass melee broke out following James Chester\u2019s firm, yet fair, tackle on Besic that earned him an undeserved yellow card.

The trio had previously not spoken publicly about the incident in an elevator at the Standard Hotel in New York City following the Met Gala held on May 5. But on Thursday, they broke their silence. The family referred CNN to a statement they previously gave to the Associated Press. The statement says: . \"As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. \"They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family. \"The reports of Solange being intoxicated or displaying erratic behavior throughout that evening are simply false.

The son of former world snooker champion Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins has been jailed today for carrying out a dawn robbery on a newsagents. Jordan Higgins, 31, was high on drink and drugs when he snatched a haul of cigarettes worth \u00a31,500 from a display shelf after he and a masked accomplice burst into the shop  in Cheadle, Greater Manchester. During the attack Higgins stormed round the back of the counter and grabbed Steven Gee by the throat and pushed him onto a stool. He then emptied the cigarettes off the shelves into a duvet cover before running off and escaping in a getaway car. He was arrested after his DNA was matched to the crime scene. The robbery last January occurred after Higgins - who has a string of convictions - battled a lengthy drug and alcohol problem during which he was admitted to a rehabilitation clinic at the age of just 14. He was also said to have struggled living in the shadow of his late father who died aged 61 in 2010 after battling throat cancer. At Minshull Street Crown Court today, the late snooker star's former wife Lynn and daughter Lauren wept in the public gallery as Jordan - who was given the middle name Alexander - was locked away for 18 months after admitting robbery. Sentencing Judge John Potter told him: 'Regrettably this is not the first time you find yourself standing in the dock of a criminal court for a criminal offence. 'You do have previous convictions recorded against you which I have considered carefully including previous for alcohol, causing loss to others by way of damage and assault. 'You knew what was going on and knew the robbery was to take place. You have targeted somebody simply trying to earn a living. 'He was alone so was vulnerable. You ran away and as you did you discarded your scarf and glove and further analysis on the DNA was recovered linking you to the commission of the offence. 'I accept your remorse is now genuine and at the time you were riddled with the associated difficulties and problems that alcohol and drug addiction brings to people but as you know that is absolutely no excuse for your behaviour. 'I accept you are somebody who has had a difficult upbringing and you have had to live in the glare of publicity with a father, that according to the testimonials, was hardly the proper role model to a son. 'But that is also no excuse to target Mr Gee as you did. I view this so serious only immediate custody is appropriate.' Earlier Andrew Long prosecuting said the robbery began when Higgins, from Cheadle, and his accomplice drew up in a car and burst in wearing scarves over their faces. Tragedy: Alex Higgins, left and right, is considered one of the snooker greats, but he struggled with drinking, gambling, and drug use until his death in 2010 . He added: 'The defendant grabbed Mr Gee by the throat and walked him backwards squeezing his throat and dragged him to a stool behind the counter. 'The two men then set about trying to steal the cigarettes. The other man got a duvet and put the cigarettes in and both men pulled the shelf off the display and took it towards the car. 'Mr Gee pressed the silent alarm and when they left the shop he locked them out. They left the shop with the tray, leaving the duvet behind with around \u00a31,500 of cigarettes. 'They got back in the car and drove away at speed but crashed it. The defendant was the passenger in the car which was bearing false registration plates. 'The two men ran through the gardens and the police were able to follow where some items were discarded including the scarf worn by the defendant. The passenger side airbag was also deployed. The glove, mask and airbag had the defendant's DNA on.' Jordan Higgins was high on drink and drugs when he snatched a haul of cigarettes worth \u00a31,500 from a display shelf after he and a masked accomplice burst into the shop (pictured) in Cheadle, Greater Manchester . In mitigation defence counsel Estelle Parkhouse said: 'He was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and the CCTV demonstrates this is a less sophisticated robbery. 'He wasn't thinking very clearly. Prior to Christmas he lost the employment he had for three years and in addition his long term relationship had broken down. 'He then started using drugs and alcohol to block out the difficulties. She added: 'He has lived in the shadow of his father's fame and success and unfortunately it has been a life of constant scrutiny. The pressures placed upon him have been difficult to bear. At 14 years old he went to the Priory for misuse of alcohol. 'After that, unfortunately, his misuse escalated and he started using Class A drugs. This offence is wholly out of character. She went on to explain how he had led a 'troubled childhood that was 'far from a charmed existence. During the attack Jordan Higgins stormed round the back of the counter and grabbed Steven Gee (pictured) by the throat and pushed him onto a stool . 'His father's behaviour is described in the letters by his sister and mum. He was exposed to alcohol and drugs from an early age and has an addictive personality but since the offence he has addressed his problem with drugs. 'He has a very close relationship with his mother and sister and an incredibly close relationship with his grandparents who are in their 80s. 'His grandfather was by far a more appropriate father figure than his father was. This offence wasn't committed because he needed money but he can't provide an explanation as to why he got involved. He is disgusted by his behaviour and is genuinely sorry for the harm caused.' After the case Mr Gee, 51, described the 'very scary' experience of being robbed in his shop. 'I didn't know if they had weapons or if they were prepared to really hurt me or what. The police were here within minutes but I was very shaken up,' he said. 'I was very surprised more than anything when I heard who it was who did it. Unfortunately the way his dad's life panned out could have affected this young man. Losing any loved one affects people differently. In a way I feel sorry for him.' Jordan was born a year after his father - who came to be known as 'The People's Champion' - won the World Snooker Championship in 1982 during which the star sobbed as he hugged then-wife Lynne and one-year-old daughter Lauren. The Hurricane had already been World Champion and runner-up in 1976 and 1980. He won the UK Championship in 1983 and the Masters in 1978 and 1981, making him one of nine players to have completed snooker's Triple Crown. He was also World Doubles champion with Jimmy White in 1984, and won the World Cup three times with the All Ireland team. Jordan was born a year after his father - who came to be known as 'The People's Champion' - famously won the World Snooker Championship in 1982. Alex Higgins is pictured next to his daughter and wife Lynn . But tragically Higgins snr's career subsequently crumbled under a litany of fines, bans and court-cases. He was left penniless after losing his luxury house in Cheshire to the taxman and was eventually stopped from seeing Jordan and Lauren following his divorce with Lynn. He was a heavy smoker, struggled with drinking and gambling and admitted to using cocaine and marijuana. Diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998, Higgins died of the illness in his Belfast home on 24 July 2010. Jordan was a pallbearer at his father's funeral alongside snooker stars Jimmy White and Ken Doherty.",

After enraging many Hispanic voters last month by delaying a change in immigration policies until after the November midterm elections, Obama has faced widespread condemnation from a voting bloc that helped him win the presidency in 2008 and 2012. Latinos remain critical to Democrats' hopes of holding onto the White House, not to mention Obama's legacy, so the president said he would use the coming weeks to gin up support among the U.S. public for another shot at reform. Speaking at an annual gala held by Hispanic lawmakers, Obama said he shared the group's frustration but needed its support to make any reform last beyond his presidency, which concludes in a little more than two years. Rallying support: US President Barack Obama delivers remarks on immigration reform at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 37th Annual Awards Gala in Washington DC on Thursday . Heckler: A woman who was shouting at President Barack Obama as he addressed the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 37th annual awards gala is removed from the banquet hall in Washington . Angry: The activist, idenitifed as Blanca Hernandez of Washington D.C., was shouting remarks at Obama before she was escorted from the premises by security . Opinion: Hernandez  heckled Obama over lack of executive action on deportation during the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Awards Gala at the Washington Convention Center . 'I know there's deep frustration in many communities around the country right now, and I understand that frustration because I share it,' he said at the Washington gala. 'But if anybody wants to know where my heart is or whether I want to have this fight, let me put those questions to rest right now: I am not going to give up this fight until it gets done.' Republicans in the House of Representatives blocked bipartisan immigration legislation passed by the Senate in 2013, and the Latino community has demanded Obama deliver on a promise to use his executive authority to ease deportations of some of the more than 11 million undocumented people in the country. Obama had promised to take that step before the end of the summer, only to delay it because of fears it could hurt Democrats running for election in conservative states in November. The president reiterated on Thursday he would take action before the end of the year, a pledge that irritated Republicans. 'The president\u2019s promise isn\u2019t about making the best policy or enforcing the law -- it\u2019s an admission that his pledge to not uphold the law in the future would be bad for his party now,' said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell in a statement. Obama's speech was interrupted by a heckler, identified as Blanca Hernandez, who gave him a hard time for failing to take executive action on deportations. But the rest of the crowd largely embraced the president, representing another twist in a relationship that at times resembles that of a married couple repeatedly squabbling and making up. Obama has missed the annual gala held by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus the last two years. Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a leading advocate for comprehensive immigration legislation, illustrated the difficult ties Hispanic-Americans have had with Obama during the past six years. 'It's clear that anybody that looks at this says, ''Wow, we weren't the priority we should have been and we weren't the priority he promised we'd be'',' Gutierrez said in an interview before the speech, while expressing hope that Obama's Thursday remarks would be a positive sign.",

A 12 year old New Zealand boy who is losing his sight wants to fill a 'visual bucket list' before he goes blind. Louis Corbett, who together with two of his older brothers suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary condition that robs sufferers of their sight, sometimes within months, is in a race against time to experience some of the world\u2019s wonders before it\u2019s too late. His parents, Catherine and Tim, asked him what he would like to see most \u2013 and the brave boy came up with a heart-warming hit list. Boy on a mission: Louis Corbett wants to complete his bucket list before he goes blind . Louis, from Auckland, chose the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, the Empire State Building and, in a sign of the times, Google headquarters in California. And unlike most Kiwis, who have a passion for either rugby or cricket, he also said he wanted to watch a live Boston Celtics basketball game in the US. 'Last year was a hard one for poor Louis,' Mrs Corbett told CNN. 'That's when he learned that his case was accelerated. '(But) this year we're going to try and fill his world with as many beautiful images as we can. 'For some reason he really got hooked on American basketball. He cares about nothing else. He is really quite passionate about it.' In control: Louis's list has involved him travelling to the United States . Game on: Louis Corbett (left) with brother Jerome will watch the Boston Celtics live this week . With Louis' eyesight fading rapidly - by 50% in the past year alone - the trip was going to have to happen soon. A Boston-based businessman heard of the family\u2019s plight and moved to make the little boy\u2019s dream come true. Warren Casey, CEO of a US-based software firm, made a large donation and vowed to raise even more so Louis and his family could be in Boston for the Celtic\u2019s game against the Golden State Warriors on March 5. 'I did it because the Corbetts are my next door neighbours,' said Mr Casey, who splits his time between Boston and his home in Auckland. He persuaded Air New Zealand to pay for the airfare and donated his own points. Thanks to the generosity of Mr Casey and his partners at Ceiba Solutions, who agreed to pay for the trip no matter how much was raised, and the generosity of people around the world, more than $25,000 was raised in just four weeks. 'It is so touching,' Mrs Corbett said. 'People are just so supportive.' Enjoying life: Louis (second from top) has visited Disneyland as part of his bucket list . Sports fan: Louis (second left) has met some of his sporting idols, including New Zealand cricketers Kane Williamson (left) and Tim Southee . The fund-raising campaign also came to the attention of Corinne Grousbeck, wife of Celtics CEO Wycliffe 'Wyc' Grousbeck, whose 21-year-old son suffers from a similar condition to Louis\u2019. 'Somebody tweeted me an article about this boy in New Zealand and told me I should read it,' said Mrs Grousbeck, incoming chairwoman of the Perkins School for the Blind. 'I completely understood where the Corbetts were coming from in wanting to build a visual memory bank for (Louis). It's an incredibly difficult thing to have to go through. 'Of course when I read about how he was a big Celtics fan, I knew that we had to have him come for a game.\u201d While Mrs Grousbeck said she would ensure Louis and his family get some of the best seats in the house, she said the real show would be before tipoff, when the Perkins chorus sings the US national anthem. 'I think for a 12-year-old like Louis, for him to be able to watch visually impaired kids perform the national anthem on a national stage, for him to see what blind people can achieve, that's going to give him the lasting memory,' she said. Whiz kid: Louis has visited Google HQ in California . Time of his laugh: Louis hasn't lost his sense of humour despite his condition .",

He died Wednesday night of an unspecified illness at his home in London. \"My family and I mourn Lucian Freud not only as one of the great painters of the twentieth century but also as a very dear friend,\" said his longtime dealer William R. Acquavella in a written statement. \"As the foremost figurative artist of his generation he imbued both portraiture and landscape with profound insight, drama and energy. In company he was exciting, humble, warm and witty. He lived to paint and painted until the day he died, far removed from the noise of the art world.\" In 2008, one of Freud's works -- the 1995 painting \"Benefits Supervisor Sleeping\" -- fetched $33.6 million during bidding at Christie's auction house in New York, setting a then-record for a work by a living artist. The painting depicts Sue Tilley, a manager of a government-run job center in London, lying naked on her side on a worn-out couch with nothing to hide her folds of flesh. The son of architect Ernst Freud and the grandson of psychoanalysis founder Sigmund Freud, Lucian was born in 1922 in Berlin. Eleven years later, as Nazism was rising, he and his family fled to London. There, he and his two brothers enrolled in English schools. He served as a merchant seaman in the Atlantic in 1941. He studied for a brief time at the Central School of Art in London and at Cedric Morris' East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing in Dedham, according to a biography posted by the Tate Modern in London, where he had an exhibition. But he received little formal training in art, according to a statement from his publicist, Bettina Prentice. Freud had his first solo exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery in 1944. In his 20s, he was using delicately, thinly applied oils in his paintings of people, animals, and plants, which were shown in unusual juxtapositions. His subjects were precise, crisp and cleanly contoured. But in the mid-1950s, he replaced his sable brushes for brushes made of coarse hog hair and used looser strokes to more freely depict his subjects. It was during that decade that he concentrated on the portrait, which became the focus of his work. In 1966, he painted his first nude. \"I paint people,\" he said. \"Not because of what they are like, not exactly in spite of what they are like, but how they happen to be.\" By the 1980s, Freud was applying thick layers of paint to convey a tactile sense of reality. \"I want paint to work as flesh,\" he told his biographer, Lawrence Gowing, in 1982. \"As far as I am concerned the paint is the person. I want it to work for me as flesh does.\" Throughout his life, he remained committed to realism. Though he painted commissioned portraits for the likes of Lord Rothschild and the queen of England, most of his subjects were his lovers, relatives and friends -- including artists Francis Bacon and David Hockney. They were typically painted in daily sessions that lasted six hours and stretched over weeks, months or years. \"The picture, in order to move us, must never merely remind us of life, but must acquire a life of its own, precisely in order to reflect life,\" Freud said in a program broadcast by the BBC. Freud's work has been exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, the Museo Correr in Venice, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Tate Britain, the Scottish National Gallery of Art, the Stadtisches Kunstmuseum Spendhaus Reutlingen in Germany, the Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst Frankfurt, Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid, the Fundacio La Caixa in Barcelona, the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, and the Setagaya Art Museum in Tokyo. His marriage to Kitty Garman in 1948 ended in divorce, as did his second marriage, to Lady Caroline Blackwood. \"He is survived by many children from his first marriage and from a series of romantic relationships,\" his publicist said. CNN's Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report .",

Bush was filmed speaking to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin during Friday's opening ceremonies and said Sunday that he \"was firm with Vladimir Putin\" and that \"this violence is unacceptable.\" Violence has continued to rage between Russia and the western ally since Thursday, when Georgia launched an operation to crack down on separatists in South Ossetia territory. Russia said it wanted to protect its peacekeepers already in South Ossetia following ceasefires in years past. But Georgia called it a full-on invasion. And while Russia has accused Georgia of a genocidal plot to cleanse the region of ethnic Ossetians loyal to Russia, Georgia accuses Russia of executing a long-planned war with the aim of taking control of the region -- including a key pipeline that carries Asian oil to Black Sea ports. \"I expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia,\" Bush said of his talk with Putin. \"We strongly condemn bombing outside of South Ossetia.\" Putin says he's concerned about the flood of refugees arriving in Russia from South Ossetia. Russian officials said more than 30,000 refugees have left South Ossetia and crossed into Russia over the past two days, Interfax reported. \"The actions of the Georgian authorities in South Ossetia are a crime, of course, primarily a crime against their own people,\" Putin said, according to Russian news agency Interfax. Meanwhile, Cheney talked to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili on Sunday, telling him that Russia's aggression against Georgia \"must not go unanswered.\" Cheney's spokeswoman Lea Ann McBride said the vice president spoke to Saakashvili to express \"the United States' solidarity with the Georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" Georgia withdrew its forces Sunday and offered a ceasefire, which Russia refused. \"The vice president told President Saakashvili that Russian aggression must not go unanswered, and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States, as well as the broader international community,\" McBride said. Saakashvili has called on the United States and the world community to stop the \"intervention and invasion of my sovereign country.\" \"I think the U.S. is the most powerful country in the world,\" he told CNN. \"I think the U.S. has lots of leverage. And I think there are lots of diplomatic means that it could be done through.\" Two senior officials have told CNN the United States sent envoy Matt Bryza to the region to help with mediation.",

This episode benefits in many ways, though, because the developer, Sucker Punch, start working with Sony early into the development cycle of the PS4 and really get a sense of how the new console would work. A new protagonist and a new city let the animators really explore areas of expression that they couldn't do with the older generation consoles. Animation director Billy Harper said the result is a real city -- Seattle -- that feels more natural than those in previous \"inFamous\" titles. \"We took the familiarity of the 'inFamous' universe. We know what makes people happy. We know what makes us grin,\" Harper told CNN. \"We decided to essentially rework everything else, because the PlayStation 4 let us.\" Seattle, where Sucker Punch is based, is rendered in fine detail -- from the familiar spire of the Space Needle to shops along Puget Sound. Cut scenes and in-game dynamics work together to show how the player has already interacted with buildings or other people, and create deeper player immersion. \"We're able to get all the subtleties in the characters themselves and all the nuances of actors,\" Harper said. \"We're capturing every single thing we get on stage, which is totally insane. We avoid the 'Uncanny Valley' (digital characters that appear too lifelike) effect you usually see in most games.\" John Koller, vice president of marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment America, said it was important to bring in the crew from Sucker Punch before the PS4 was launched to give console builders a better idea how developers were going to use the new device. \"The PS4 was done hand in hand with development and 'inFamous' was one of those titles brought in early,\" Koller said. The result was not only an open-world game with plenty of action, but a wide-ranging story that explores the moral quandaries ingrained within the franchise's story. Do you choose the path of the hero, or flip the coin and become the villain? \"How ruthless can you be? How heroic can you be? How true can you stay to that (path) to earn the biggest reward?\" says Jennifer Dean, public relations manager for SCEA. While Koller won't call \"Second Son\" the PS4's killer app, chatter on social media and forum have shown many people are using the game as their \"excuse\" to buy the new console. However, expectations from fans and critics alike are very high. \"'inFamous' has always been my favorite Sony-exclusive franchise, and the first 'inFamous' was actually the reason I bought a PlayStation 3 a few years into its lifecycle. Everything I saw at PAX Prime 2013 made me say that I would own a PlayStation 4 prior to the launch of 'inFamous: Second Son', just because the title wowed me that much,\" explained Brian Shea, editor-in-chief of Video Game Writers. \"I expect it to deliver the same open-world superhero experience the first two retail entries brought us, but in a way that harnesses the power of the PlayStation 4.\" Koller said this is just the beginning for what he calls blockbuster titles for the PS4, and explains there is a strategy to it all. With \"Destiny,\" \"Watch_Dogs,\" \"The Order: 1886,\" and \"Uncharted 4\" on the horizon, he thinks \"inFamous: Second Son\" has the initial lasting power to potentially sell more hardware. \"You buy a platform and you're actually looking not only at the game you're buying today, but the content that's coming ... because that promise is really important when you are putting down $399 for hardware,\" Koller said. Harper pointed out it was a huge benefit for Sucker Punch to hold off releasing the new title until they could do something to show off the new console's power. \"A lot of what we wanted to do was provide justification for purchasing the hardware,\" Harper said. \"In the process, it gave us so much (flexibility) to actually let people justify buying another 'inFamous' title. It is as close as you can get to buying a new IP (intellectual property) utilizing the same universe.\" However, a five-month delay for a blockbuster title could have spelled potential doom as it has for other new console starts (i.e.: Nintendo's Wii U). Nintendo sales of their new console struggled in its fledgling months, mostly due to the lack of gaming titles that appealed to their audience. Shea doesn't think Sony is in any danger, and actually will benefit from the release time. \"Sony has a much better relationship with third-party developers than Nintendo does, and right now Sony just has more credibility with core gamers,\" Shea said. \"The success or failure of 'inFamous: Second Son' won't change any of those facts. That said, if 'inFamous' does click with gamers, the PlayStation 4 will be a hard console to compete with.\" \"inFamous: Second Son\" is a PlayStation 4 exclusive and was released worldwide on March 21. It is rated T for Teen due to blood, drug reference, language, sexual themes, and violence.",

Attendance:\u00a034,977 . Ratings by SAM CUNNINGHAM at Upton Park . This morning, as his team reflect on their third win in succession and look down on all but a handful of the Premier League, his job seems blissfully secure. Allardyce spoke of \u2018a terrific performance\u2019 and \u2018a massive, massive victory\u2019. Indeed it was. As a consequence of a full-hearted, soundly-organised effort, the title ambitions of Chelsea have moved into sharper focus. As a further consequence, the continued tenure of City\u2019s Manuel Pellegrini is coming into question. The Chilean denied feeling under any pressure, but since he also asserted that his team had deserved to win this absorbing match, his judgment may not be entirely reliable. For City are currently playing like strangers to their real form. A side which once reeked of class, now reeks of something like passive complacency, a malady best demonstrated by the man who was once their most devastating player. Until the team finally found itself, deep in the second half, Yaya Toure had performed like a weary irrelevance. His impact was minimal, his contribution belying the talent which had once made him one of the English game\u2019s most illustrious imports. Just as Song toiled and sweated for the midfield control he enjoyed, so Toure seemed reluctant to join the battle. With Sergio Aguero untypically missing chances galore, with Eliaquim Mangala suffering a merciless chasing from West Ham\u2019s front men, and with Vincent Kompany not only equally ineffective but hugely fortunate to remain on the field after a string of frustrated lunges, the wonder was that City remained in the argument for so long. Goals from Morgan Amalfitano and Diafra Sakho had carried West Ham clear and, despite a fine retaliation from the admirable David Silva late on, City never did enough to state a plausible case. They were left to curse a number of squandered opportunities, but they had done little to deserve equality. Their rally had arrived too late and carried too little conviction. They began with a degree of optimism. Aguero, running from half way, battered a drive which caught a deflection and saw Adrian scrambling at the foot of a post. Then Silva struck a free kick a foot over from 22 yards. And that was about as good as it got for City in the first half. As Song assumed total midfield control and the front runners Morgan Amalfitano and Enner Valencia began to persecute City\u2019s centre-backs, the champions were reduced to hopeful retaliation on the break. A West Ham success seemed inevitable, and it came in the 21st minute. Song slid a pass down the right, Valencia sprinted on, reached the byline and pulled back an inviting cross. The ball evaded Pablo Zabaleta, and Amalfitano was awarded the simplest tap-in. It was no more than West Ham\u2019s control had deserved.

The notion that Allardyce\u2019s side have suddenly become a team of tap dancers is fanciful. They are strong, muscular, relentlessly direct. But this should have come as no great surprise to City. They knew precisely what would confront them, and they failed to cope with the problems. For a side with title pretensions, it was woeful. West Ham were winning battles all over the pitch, and might have scored a second when Valencia dived at a half-chance as a low cross came skidding in from Aaron Cresswell. Kompany was booked on 44 minutes for cleaning out Valencia with a peevish assault. Then, from the rarest of breaks, City might have equalised on the stroke of half time, when Aguero almost squeezed in a chance at the near post. He failed, and it would have been a travesty had he succeeded. Pellegrini sat in the dug out, shaking his head. This was not how the plot was supposed to unfold. The City manager sent out the same side for the second half, presumably obeying the managerial dictum which says: \u2018You lot got us into this. You can get us out.\u2019 Yet his team\u2019s plight might well have grown even worse when the thoroughly rattled Kompany went crashing into Valencia and escaped the card which would have seen him dismissed. Nevertheless, City started to enter the game. Toure began to appear vaguely interested, and the appearance of Stevan Jovetic for Edin Dzeko introduced an extra sense of purpose. After 59 minutes, they had their best chance yet but Aguero\u2019s shot was saved by Adrian\u2019s knees. A minute later, the Argentine struck the bar and the ball bounced down to Toure, who drove it into the goalkeeper\u2019s midriff from four yards. By now, the fight was on, and City seemed more likely to prosper when an interchange between Silva and Aguero allowed Toure to bounce a drive against the angle of post and bar. But in the 75th minute, West Ham appeared to strike the decisive blow, when Cresswell, advancing down the left, flighted a cross and Sakho, leaping immoderately, scored the header, becoming just the second player to score in all of his first six Premier League starts. But, as Upton Park celebrated, City began to play their most impressive football of the match. At last, the fluid movement which had been absent returned with a rush, and their reward arrived within two minutes. Silva picked his way nimbly from the right, deceived Mark Noble, and swirled the most precise drive inside the far post. From there on, the match was up for grabs, with City making despairing efforts to take the consolation of a point. But West Ham survived the frenzied attacks, and at the final whistle, they collapsed in claret and blue heaps all over the field; exhausted, but justly triumphant.

After their relationship ended, Miss Hamilton began seeing one of Miss Brown\u2019s close friends who also worked at the charity. She is said to have sent Miss Brown a Valentine card last February after the relationship had ended, which left her confused. Last August, Miss Brown was found hanged at her flat in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. An inquest will be held later this year. There is no suggestion that her relationship with Miss Hamilton was in any way linked to her suicide. However, police investigating the death are understood to want to look at a laptop on which Miss Brown is said to have kept a personal journal, which included her thoughts on her relationship with Miss Hamilton. It has been claimed that after the laptop was returned to Blue Cross following her death the journal was deleted, but parts of it have now been recovered. Blue Cross is a charity that provides support for pet owners who cannot afford private veterinary treatment, helps to find homes for unwanted animals, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership . The charity\u2019s website states that Miss Hamilton lives in a \u2018sleepy village with her partner Maria and their beloved dogs\u2019. Miss Hamilton split from private investigator Maria Cooper two years ago. She now lives in London with her new girlfriend, who no longer works for Blue Cross. The charity was founded in 1897 and has four animal hospitals, 12 rehoming centres and an income of \u00a331million. Chairman Zair Berry said last night that no comment could be made until after Miss Brown\u2019s inquest, and that Mr Crossley left in 2012 \u2018for purely performance-related reasons\u2019. Mr Crossley, who now works for the Marine Conservation Society, declined to comment at his home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.",

The newest UV robot, nicknamed 'Violet,' was recently given to UPMC Passavant by the Passavant Hospital Foundation. Since February, the health system has used UV robots in a pilot project at three of its other hospitals \u2013 UPMC Presbyterian, UPMC Montefiore and UPMC Shadyside \u2013 and is considering them for additional hospitals. 'Hospital-associated infections are an issue nationwide and preventing them at UPMC hospitals is a top priority. Video Source YouTube . 'These robots, coupled with our many other infection prevention measures, are an important tool in ensuring patient safety. We are grateful to the Passavant Hospital Foundation for helping us to expand their use,' said Tami Minnier, chief quality officer of UPMC. 'The robot enhances the cleaning done by our employees.

Using a variety of methods, high-energy ultraviolet light in the area of the spectrum known as UV-C is produced by either mercury or xenon gas lamps. This UV-C energy passes through the cell walls of bacteria, viruses and bacterial spores. Once the UV-C energy is inside the microorganism, it is absorbed by the DNA, RNA and proteins. One of the primary mechanisms of damage created by UV-C is the fusing of the strands of DNA creating what is known as 'thymine dimers.' Once the DNA is fused, the organism can no longer replicate and is, therefore, no longer infectious. The technical term for this is 'deactivation.' 'The robot does not scrub surfaces or remove dirt; it kills microscopic germs that can be missed in even the most thorough cleaning,' said Joseph Romano, M.D., UPMC infectious disease physician. Previous peer-reviewed studies at hospitals outside the UPMC system have shown that UV robots reduce bacterial contamination in hospital rooms by as much as 95 percent and cut hospital-associated infections by more than half.

In the U.S. each year, more people die from a lack of hospital infection control than from AIDS, breast cancer, and auto accidents combined, and have an estimated annual cost of $40 billion.",

They are the words everyone dreads hearing from their doctor ... and the fact they are delivered over the phone can only compound the trauma. Yet last night it emerged that many patients are being told they have cancer in a phone call rather than a face-to-face meeting.

Jim Morrison, chairman of Burton . Hospitals in Staffordshire, told the trust\u2019s directors he had been . shocked such a warning was needed. But on internet support forums, dozens of cancer patients said the same thing had happened to them. The phone call incident was the subject of one of 82 complaints made to the trust between October and December 2011 (posed) One man said he had complained after his wife was given the news in this way. \u2018She was on her own in the house \u2013 no . one else with her,\u2019 he wrote on the Macmillan Cancer Support forum. \u2018It . just beggars belief \u2013 do they not do this in training to be a doctor, . how to break bad news to patients?\u2019 Dozens of patients then replied to his . message, saying they had had the same experience.

The shock report calls on officials to 'urgently confront the corrupting influence of dishonesty' within the army, warning officers have become 'ethically numb'. The situation has become so bad, the executive summary concludes it has 'allowed leaders to espouse lofty professional values while slogging through the mire of dishonesty and deceit'.

Report authors\u00a0Leonard Wong and Stephen J. Gerras say it is often justified one of three ways: 'mission accomplishment', 'supporting the troops' or that the task or reporting requirement is unreasonable or 'dumb'. They go onto note lying and 'adjusting the truth' is so common, military personnel who order a report do not trust its content. The report authors, who interviewed staff at all levels in the army in order to compile the 53-page document, state: 'It appears that a peculiar situation where those requesting the information, and those supplying it know that the information is questionable.'

As Chris Christie leaves his 'bridge-gate' troubles behind and flies to Florida to campaign for a fellow Republican, a New Jersey mayor has made more damning accusations against the Governor. Hoboken mayor Dawn Zimmer has claimed Hurricane Sandy relief aid was withheld from her city in an attempt to push through a redevelopment backed by the New Jersey Governor. Ms Zimmer alleged that two of Christie's aides - Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno and community affairs commissioner Richard Constable - leaned on her to gain support for a lucrative deal. Cut off: Hoboken mayor Dawn Zimmer claims Sandy relief money was withheld to try to force her to approve a lucrative redevelopment deal . Tough week: Governor Christie gives the state address on January 14, as his administration is hit by accusations over 'bridge-gate' 'The bottom line is, it\u2019s not fair for . the governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the City of Hoboken because . he wants me to give back to one private developer,' she told MSNBC. Sandy devastated nearly 80 per cent of the Hoboken community in 2012, and Christie had immediately promised its residents that he would 'be here to help'. But when Ms Zimmer requested $127 million in relief aid, she was given just $142,000 to cover the cost of a back up generator, and $200,000 in recovery grants from a $1.8 million fund, MSNBC\u00a0 reported. In a letter written to Christie about the low funds, Ms Zimmer wrote: 'Please . governor, we need . your help. I have tried to assure Hoboken residents that we would be . treated fairly.' No response has been received from the letter, which was dated May 8, 2013 - the same day the city's planning board rejected a redevelopment recommendation for Rockefeller. According to emails, public records and her diary entries, Ms Zimmer claims Christie's aides were willing to cut off constituents and use public funds to finance a study for the governor-backed plans. The project, a mass redevelopment proposed by the Rockefeller Group, was already in the pipeline when Ms Zimmer was elected as mayor. Wrecked: Huge parts of Hoboken were flooded when Sandy hit in October 2012 . Aid: A Hoboken shop tries to run without any power after the storm in 2012 . The lucrative deal in a popular commuter area would have given the developers a free rein to build what they wanted while applying for millions of dollars in subsidies. Ms Zimmer told MSNBC she wasn't against the plan, but she did want an independent study on the projected deal to take place. But when the study and Hoboken board rejected the need for redevelopment, much-needed Sandy relief money was cut off, Ms Zimmer claims. According to a diary entry from the mayor, Lieutenant Governor Guadagno pulled her aside during an event in Hoboken on May 13, last year. The diary entry read: 'She pulls me aside with . no one else around and says that I need to move forward with the . Rockefeller project. It is very important to the governor. ' \"The word is . that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going . to be able to help you. I know it\u2019s not right \u2013 these things should not . be connected \u2013 but they are\", she says, and \"if you tell anyone, I will . deny it\".' Then, in a diary entry for May 17, Ms Zimmer claimed as she was preparing to appear on a televised panel about the Sandy recovery, Commissioner Constable leaned in and told her 'Everyone in the State House believes you are against [the Rockefeller project].' Ms Zimmer denied she was against it, but Commissioner Constable then allegedly told her: 'If you move that forward, the money would start flowing to . you.' Claims: Chris Christie with Community Affairs Commissioner Richard Constable, who allegedly leaned on Dawn Zimmer to support a project in return for more Sandy aid . 'Pressure': Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno allegedly told Mayor Zimmer if she didn't move forward with the project, the administration would not be able to help her . Spokesmen for Governor Christie and community affairs commissioner Constable have denied the allegations. A spokeswoman for the commissioner said: 'Mayor Zimmer\u2019s . allegation that on May 16, 2013, Commissioner Constable conditioned . Hoboken\u2019s receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development . project is categorically false.' The Governor's spokesman, Michael Drewniak, released a statement that read: 'Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public praise of the Governor\u2019s Office and the assistance we\u2019ve provided in terms of economic development and Sandy aid.' 'What or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone\u2019s guess.' A spokesman for the Rockefellar Group said: 'We . have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation. If . it turns out to be true it would be deplorable.' Despite the 'bridge-gate' scandal, many Republicans have come to Governor Christie's defense and praised him for taking action. Others have said the future of the man who had been tipped to be a presidential contender rests on whether his account of when he learned of the bridge scandal is found to be accurate.",

Labour has received more than \u00a318million in \u2018soft loans\u2019 from the Co-op Bank \u2013 which is to be the subject of an independent inquiry ordered by Chancellor George Osborne. Documents lodged with the Electoral Commission reveal the Co-op has been propping up the Labour Party for years with a string of generous loans and overdraft facilities at rock-bottom rates. The party is facing acute embarrassment over its links with the troubled lender, which David Cameron told the Commons had been \u2018driven into the wall\u2019 by its disgraced former boss Reverend Paul Flowers. The Co-op is seeking a \u00a31.5billion . recapitalisation after being plunged into crisis thanks largely to bad . loans associated with its takeover of Britannia Building Society in . 2009. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today called Flowers' rise to the top of the Co-op Bank 'extremely murky'. 'I'm sure the Labour Party will want to both account for itself but also make sure that, in addition to all the question marks that still exist about the way in which they act almost as puppets on the end of a string for the trade union bosses, that they are not also in hock to some slightly off characters at this bank,' he toldLBC 97.3. The Prime Minister told the Commons the debacle needed to be investigated thoroughly. The Government\u2019s first priority was to safeguard the Co-op Bank and ensure customers and bondholders were protected, he said, but he raised a series of questions about Flowers\u2019s suitability for a top banking job and his links with Labour. Government sources said an inquiry was likely to be ordered within days by the Prudential Regulation Authority, under powers Mr Osborne obtained in the 2012 Financial Services Act. A separate investigation could be launched by the Financial Conduct Authority into whether the bank broke City rules. Links: Labour is facing acute embarrassment over its links with the troubled lender, which David Cameron, left, told the Commons had been \u2018driven into the wall\u2019 by its disgraced former boss Reverend Paul Flowers, right . The \u00a318million in Co-op loans to Labour include \u00a34million over seven years in 1999 at an interest rate of 6.8 per cent, \u00a32million in 2007 for five months at 2 per cent above base rate, a \u00a32million \u2018emergency overdraft\u2019 in 2009 at 5 per cent above base rate, and \u00a31.2million over six months in 2006 at\u00a0 2 per cent above base rate. Labour\u2019s latest Co-op loan, worth \u00a31.2million, was doled out in March this year, just weeks after Ed Miliband invited Flowers to his Commons office for private talks. The Co-op\u2019s sister organisation, the Unity Trust Bank, lent Labour an identical sum on the same day. Both loans were arranged at an interest rate of just 4 per cent \u2013 far lower than the Co-op offers to its own loyal customers \u2013 and were made despite Labour\u2019s poor credit history. Tory MP Brooks Newmark said the scandal surrounding Flowers, a former Labour councillor, had \u2018peeled back an unhealthy and poisonous relationship between Labour and the Co-op Bank\u2019. Mr Brooks, a member of the Commons Treasury committee, said the revelations raised disturbing questions about whether Labour was turning a blind eye to disastrous governance at the bank. He added: \u2018Given its dire financial circumstances the Labour Party would normally struggle to get loans from anyone other than Wonga. 'But because of its cosy relationship, which means Labour has been able to place councillors and members in key positions at the Co-op Bank, it has continued to have access to these extraordinary soft loans. \u2018Ordinary customers of the Co-op Bank and shoppers at Co-op stores will be astonished that their money is being used to make huge donations and loans at very soft rates to Ed Balls and Labour.\u2019 Mr Miliband has attempted to distance himself from Flowers in recent days, after the Methodist preacher was filmed buying hard drugs, including crack cocaine and crystal meth. But details have emerged of a cosy relationship between the two men. Mr Miliband and shadow chancellor Mr Balls hosted a Downing Street reception for Flowers and other Co-op grandees in 2010. Probe: The Co-op bank is set to be subject of an independent inquiry ordered by Chancellor George Osborne . The Labour leader then went on to appoint him to his elite Business and Industry Advisory Board. Mr Miliband also held a secretive meeting in the Commons with Flowers on March 6 this year. Three weeks later the Co-Op Bank approved the \u00a31.2million loan to Labour. In the Commons, Mr Cameron suggested Labour knew about Flowers\u2019s \u2018past\u2019, before the drugs and porn claims emerged. He said: \u2018Why was Reverend Flowers judged suitable to be chairman of a bank? Why weren\u2019t alarm bells rung earlier, particularly by those who knew?\u2019 The Prime Minister said Mr Osborne was \u2018discussing with the regulator what is the appropriate form of inquiry\u2019. Troubled: The Co-op is seeking a \u00a31.5billion recapitalisation after being plunged into crisis thanks largely to bad loans associated with its takeover of Britannia Building Society in 2009 . He told Mr Miliband: \u2018What we can now see is this bank \u2013 driven into the wall by this chairman \u2013 has been giving soft loans to the Labour Party, facilities to the Labour Party, donations to the Labour Party, trooped in and out of Downing Street under Labour, still advising you, and yet now we know all along they [Labour} knew about his past. \u2018Why did they do nothing to bring to the attention of the authorities this man who has broken a bank?\u2019 Mr Miliband told Mr Cameron: \u2018You\u2019ve taken millions from tax exiles and tax avoiders, your party has never paid back the money from Asil Nadir \u2013 and they\u2019re just the people I can talk about in this House.\u2019 Treasury Select Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: \u2018The Treasury Committee strongly recommends that any review into the Co-op Bank be conducted by an independent person.

Roy Henderson Robertson, from Scarborough in NSW, was killed in action fighting in the 20th Infantry Battalion at Gallipoli on November 7, 1915. He was just 16 years old when he was killed and he rests alongside 29 other Australians at Gallipoli's Walker's Ridge Cemetery . Jack Hodgson was left blind after he was wounded in Gallipoli around 1915. He served in the 4th Battalion and is pictured here showing his service medals to his son . Now, the library has launched an exhibition in a bid to return Roy's portrait, and those of more than 230 other First World War soldiers, to surviving family members. The portraits have hand-written, personal details on the back of each print that denote whether soldiers made it home or not. The majority of photos were taken in 1918 when First World War soldiers in NSW were invited to have their portraits taken in Sydney before they went overseas to fight. William Hugh Gilmour, 19, safely returned to Sydney in July 1919 after serving in the 25th Battalion. The Marrickville resident had worked as a clerk when he enlisted in May 1918 . Thomas Alexander Roper, 20, died of pneumonia on October 11, 1918 in South Africa. The Pyrmont resident enlisted in May 1918 and served as a private in the 12th Australian Reinforcements unit. He rests at Woltmade Cemetery in Cape Town . Ernest William Hall, 20, enlisted in Goodna Queensland on April 25, 1918. He served as a gunner before returning to Australia on April 1, 1919 - just shy of a year to the date he left . 21-year-old Francis Patrick Leonard returned to Australia on July 23, 1919. Francis, born in Longueville, worked as a clerk before he became a gunner in the Royal Australia Artillery . Sydney's Crown Studios, a leading photographic studio at the time, collected more than 1,600 portraits taken of soldiers or copied from existing prints provided by family members. The portraits, which were donated to the State Library, are now being shown for the first time in nearly 100 years as part the WWI centenary program, Portraits of War. They give a fascinating insight into the individual faces of soldiers, both young and old, who served their country. The project was never completed by the photography studio after a fire severely damaged the studio in December 1918. Edward Andrew Bolger was 20 when he enlisted on February 2, 1918. He had worked as a station manager before he served as a gunner in the 35th AFA Reinforcements . William Joseph Langworthy from Canley Vale returned to Australia on July 7, 1919. He served as a private in the 34th Battalion after enlisting on February 19, 1918 . Herbert Frank Satchell was 20 when he enlisted in December 1917. It is believed he served in the 1st Light Horse Regiment before returning home in March 1919 . Clement Cecil Hunt Wallace, 29, first enlisted in June 1915 and returned to Australia in November 1917. The Marrickville resident re-enlisted in July 1918. Clement served as a private general and later as a sergeant . Alfred Charles Fuller, 20, enlisted for the first time in August 1914 in the 4th Battalion. He returned home to Carlton in July 1916 before re-enlisting in July 1918 . 19-year-old Sydney John Miner was a station hand at Gowan Station Bathurst before he enlisted. The New Zealand born private served in the 34th Battalion before returning home in July 1919 . Duncan Hugh Murphy, 22, served as a gunner after enlisting in December 1917. The Tumbarumba-born resident returned to Australia in March 1919 . A. McGuire, born in Inverell, was a fireman before he enlisted to serve. His return date or age was not recorded but he served in the railway section . While copies of the portraits were protected in a fireproof safe, the studio did not reopen again until the following year. 'The information on the back of each print is just as moving as the portraits themselves,' exhibition curator Louise Tegart said. 'These portraits could be the only photograph families had of their sons, brothers or uncles, and this has compelled the State Library to provide copies of the portraits featured in the exhibition to the relatives of the soldiers in NSW. 'We're also keen to know more about the soldiers in the pictures and hope that relatives will come forward and help add information to their individual stories.' Edward Morey was believed to be 22 when his portrait was taken.  He was born in Naguligon in NSW and worked as a labourer before enlisting . Spencer Gordon Tucker was 23 when he was killed by a sniper at Messines in May 1917. The Carcoar-born labourer enlisted in January 1916. Spencer rests at the London Rifle Brigade Cemetery at Messines in Belgium . Reggie Nathaniel, 20, was killed in March 1917 at Bapaume in France. He was serving as a private in the 30th Battalion after enlisting in July 1915.

He returned to Australia in July 1919 after serving just over a year . 37-year-old Selwyn Frederic Betts served in the 33rd Battalion when he enlisted in March 1916. He was working as a barrister in Sydney prior to 1916 . James Patrick Hickey, 39, enlisted on October 9, 1917. He was born near Coopernook Manning River and worked as a farrier before joining the army .

The collection will go on show in a free exhibition at the State Library of NSW, from June 28 to September 21, 2014. Edward H. Watts attended St George's Boys School in Bristol, England before he immigrated to Australia in 1905. He was 33 when he enlisted in December 1917. Edward died from pneumonia in France in October 1918 and rests at the Abbeville Communal Cemetery . Abram Mahomet, 36, was born in Bombay, India.  He served as a private when he enlisted in April 1918 . Sydney-born Harry Jacob served as part of the TMCA Liverpool Camp. His enlistment date or birthdate was not recorded . Robert O.

The former couple\u2019s flatmate heard moaning noises coming from a bedroom in the moments before Shikha Godara Beniwal died, but he did not intervene because he thought they were having sex. Homicide detectives have confirmed the ex-couple, who had a three-year-old son, were known to them due to a history of domestic violence going back at least two years. Scroll down for video . Melbourne physiotherapist\u00a0Shikha Godara Beniwal was murdered by her estranged husband Sunil just four days after the intervention order she had in place against him expired . It is believed Sunil Beniwal, 36, killed Shikha Godara Beniwal at his home in Deer Park, in west Melbourne, on Saturday night or in the early hours of Sunday before committing suicide by veering into an oncoming truck. The Beniwal's  son was in the house at the time of the suspected murder, along with Sunil's unsuspecting flatmates, James Negri and his girlfriend. Negri's younger brother, Jackson Kelly, said his sibling had heard the little boy crying and  the sound of a woman moaning but didn't call the police as he thought they were having sex. He said his brother is 'shaken up' and had never witnessed any fights between the estranged couple and thought they were trying to get back together as Shikha was a regular visitor to the house. Sunil Beniwal, 36, committed suicide after murdering his estranged wife and mother of their three-year-old son . Kelly,17, told\u00a0Fairfax Media: 'They had just come back from India. I thought they were trying to work it out. 'He seemed like a nice, normal guy. I don't know why he turned like this. I can't believe it.' Although the police won't release how Shikha, 32, died until after an autopsy, they said they are yet to find a weapon and are not looking for anyone else in connection with her murder. The couple had a history of domestic abuse and were known to police but Sunil's flat-mate thought they were trying to work things out and said they recently travelled to India together . They believe Sunil murdered her and then fled in his car, committing suicide  by swerving into a truck around 4am. He died on impact and the driver, a father-of-four, Tom Delios is still in hospital. The emergency services rushed to the crash site on Hopkins Rd, Truganina, near Caroline Springs, and police discovered his wife's body just hours later at his Corey Close home at around 7.45 am.

Sunil veered his car into this mammoth truck on Hopkins Rd, Truganina, near Caroline Springs\u00a0at about 4am Sunday morning . The emergency services rushed to the crash site on Hopkins Rd, Truganina, near Caroline Springs, and police discovered his wife's body just hours later at his Corey Close home at around 7.45 am . While Sunil died on impace, the driver of the truck is still being treated in hospital for shock and minor injuries . He said: 'There was an intervention order taken out in 2012 which expired four days ago. 'It's a shocking circumstance of two people who couldn't work out their differences and it's ended in a tragedy like this. 'We need an autopsy to be carried out and once that's happened we'll be in a better position to know what has gone on.'

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\nSpc. Ivan Lopez, who ended his life after killing three people at the Fort Hood, Texas, military base Wednesday, was undergoing diagnostic procedures for post-traumatic stress disorder, according to Lt. Gen Mark Milley, Fort Hood's commanding general. He was also receiving a variety of treatments for conditions including depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances, Army Secretary John McHugh told the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday. Lopez did not receive a diagnosis of PTSD, but the incident puts the condition in the spotlight. A big challenge in helping veterans with PTSD is the amount of time that passes before a diagnosis, which can be three to four months, said Terry Lyles, a stress coach in Miami who has worked with PTSD patients and is a civilian contractor with the Department of Defense. In the general population, PTSD is diagnosed right away, but in the military there are bureaucratic holdups before a diagnosis is officially given, he said. \"The system itself gets bogged down.\" White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that more needs to be done to support military veterans and their families. \"We need to be very mindful in this country that even as those wars end, what we owe our veterans does not end,\" he said. Here are facts you should know about PTSD: . Fort Hood shooter was Iraq vet being treated for mental health issues . 1. What is PSTD? It's natural to experience fear in dangerous situations. But people with PTSD may behave as though they are under attack when there is no real imminent threat. A person who suffers PTSD typically re-experiences the trauma through flashbacks and nightmares, experiences that can seem as real as the actual trauma. The person often feels intensely that the trauma could happen again at any time. Thoughts and feelings can trigger symptoms, but so can words, situations or objects that remind the person of a traumatic situation. National Institutes of Health: PTSD . 2. How common is it? Anyone who has experienced a life-threatening situation can develop PTSD, according to Dr. Stephen J. Cozza, a professor of psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. Although over the course of a lifetime, many people have extremely distressing or threatening experiences, only a small percentage will experience PTSD, experts say. The range of responses is largely based on the amount of exposure to the stressor, said Cozza. Most studies examining the rate of PTSD in service members put the rates at about 15% to 20%. Thirty percent of service members who have fought in Iraq or Afghanistan have been diagnosed with PTSD, according to a Department of Veterans Affairs study. The nonprofit think-tank RAND Corporation estimates a third of veterans likely have some type of traumatic brain injury, PTSD or depression, which puts the overall number affected at around 600,000. \"We need to remember that while substantial numbers of vets have mental health conditions,\" the majority do not, Cozza said. \"We don't want to stigmatize our vets, because many of them are not ill,\" he said. \"As an organization and as a community, the military has varying levels of health and risk. There are more services for mental health care in the military than there has ever been before.\" What is war's true toll? The Uncounted . 3. What causes PTSD? Experiencing any kind of trauma or dangerous event -- including seeing people harmed or killed or personally getting injured -- raises the risk for PTSD. A history of mental illness also makes PTSD more likely, as does a lack of social support after a traumatic event and enduring additional stress in its aftermath. Scientists are looking at the role of genes that are involved in the creation of fear memories. There are also neuroscientists investigating brain differences in people who have PTSD. Genes and brain structural differences may raise a person's risk for the condition without causing symptoms, according to the National Institutes of Health. The early growth of the brain may be affected by environmental factors or a history of mental illness. 3. Do other mental illnesses make it worse? Other problems such as depression and insomnia that a veteran may have had before deployment are magnified with PTSD, Lyles said. \"It does not help itself,\" he said. \"It's kind of like a pinball that gets trapped inside a machine that can't get out and just continues to ping around. You try to live your life as normal as possible but it's always present.\" 4. How is it diagnosed in the military? A typical PTSD screening would be a well-structured diagnostic interview, and a few other tests, lasting about two hours, said Michael Telch, psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin. During the debriefing process from the U.S. military, returning soldiers go through an interview and other evaluations that may indicate PTSD, Lyles said. If there is reason to suspect PTSD, the veteran then goes for a full medical evaluation that involves PTSD testing. There is generally not a big lag time to make a medical diagnosis after the two-hour interview, Telch said. However, it can take months before the diagnosis is officially recognized by the military, Lyles said. Many cases of PTSD go undetected because some view the condition as a sign of weakness. Some also don't want to go through the extra battery of tests when they return home, he said. \"Many of these individuals fall through the cracks,\" Lyles said. 5. Do people with PTSD pose an increased risk of violence to themselves or others? Having PTSD does not mean that a person will be violent. But certain sounds, images and smells can trigger alarming memories to a person with the condition, and they react as if they were in the midst of war. \"Reality becomes skewed because you've been trained to be violent,\" Lyles said. \"So it's really hard to shut that out.\" PTSD is not only about fear and anxiety. Patients may experience other kinds of emotional disturbances, and violence may be a way that they respond. \"Coping with strong feelings of anger, shame or guilt can be played out in terms of violent behavior,\" Telch said. Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who struggle with anger are twice as likely as other vets to be arrested for crimes, according to the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, which published a study last year. The study, conducted by the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Medicine, examined 1,388 combat veterans. Researchers found that about 23% of those with PTSD and high irritability had been arrested for criminal offenses. But researchers also found that other factors unrelated to military service -- including growing up around violence or drug abuse -- were factors behind why some vets committed crimes. 6. Does this impact veterans' performance in the workplace, after they leave the service? Employers sometimes cite PTSD as a reason for not hiring veterans, because of public misunderstanding, former President George W. Bush said in February at the George W. Bush Library Military Service Initiative. The condition, he said, is mislabeled as a \"disorder.\" \"Employers would not hesitate to hire an employee getting treated for a medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure, and they should not hesitate to hire veterans getting treated for post-traumatic stress,\" Bush said. A person who has been successful in treatment should be able to function in the workplace, Telch said. But without treatment, symptoms can be severe, and impair functioning at work, in social situations and in the family. 8. How do people with PTSD come back to normal? Exposure therapy often helps the person with PTSD revisit or re-experience their trauma as a means of lessening the effect the memory has on them, said Dr. Albert \"Skip\" Rizzo, a psychiatrist who works with the military and has pioneered use of virtual reality for treating PTSD. This kind of therapy has been around for years. Typically a therapist would ask someone to imagine they are experiencing their trauma again. This would happen repeatedly, and ideally, with each retelling of what happened, the event would seem gradually less threatening. Rizzo, who is with the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California, and other experts have employed virtual reality for this purpose. Patients wear goggles and describe their experiences while a technician stands by with a console changing the scene to fit the patient's description. If the patient recalls hearing a young boy's voice, for instance, the technician makes that happen. If the patient experienced the trauma at night or in the daytime, or perhaps was involved in an IED explosion, those circumstances will be created in the virtual world. \"We can begin to pace the exposure in a very evocative fashion,\" Rizzo said. \"This works because some people don't engage in the trauma memory at a sufficient level. They don't engage fully with their imagination to confront difficult memories.\" A therapy that uses similar principles is called cognitive processing therapy. It helps patients become aware of their thoughts and feelings and learn how to deal with changes in beliefs from before and after trauma. Some patients also benefit from medication. 9. What resources are available to help service members, veterans and families? Everyone in the family of a service member with PTSD needs to be involved in the treatment plan, Lyles said. The U.S. Army Medical Department has a variety of resources on its website. These include the Real Warriors Campaign, which helps service members overcome stigma surrounding mental health treatment, and Army One Source, which helps people locate support services.

Gareth Lockyer, 34, from Warwick was paddling along the swollen River Usk, near Brecon, South Wales when his kayak capsized, tipping him into the water. The Kayak-enthusiast had been enjoying a day out on the river in February with his girlfriend Emma North but became separated from the group he was with at Llangynidr, near Crickhowell, on Sunday lunchtime. The safety strap attached to his leg became snagged on the trunk of a fallen tree, dragging him under the surface. Rescuers found his body at 11.20 GMT the following day in the swollen waters of the River Usk. During an inquest into his death in Brecon, his distraught girlfriend told how Gareth struggled to free himself from the safety strap in the fast flowing river.

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a middle school student:\n\nATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- OutKast's Big Boi is a junkie, has been for years. Big Boi: \"You can really tell a lot about a person through the shoes, so I always like to keep me a fresh pair.\" The multiplatinum rap star got his first shoe fix back when he was better known as Antwan Patton, a busboy at Steak and Ale. He saved up his paychecks and rushed to a dealer to cop the only thing that could cure his jones -- a pair of British Knights tennis shoes. \"I've actually been into sneakers since I was a little kid,\" Big Boi, 34, said backstage before his concert this month at the Sneaker Pimps exhibition in Atlanta. \"You can really tell a lot about a person through the shoes, so I always like to keep me a fresh pair.\" Sneaker culture has thrived for decades, but shoe companies have increasingly capitalized on the demand for one-of-a-kind kicks. Collectors, known as sneakerheads, have lined up to pay hundreds, even thousands, of dollars to ensure few people are wearing the same shoes.  See some of the rarest shoes \u00bb . \"Coming up, my mom got five kids so there wasn't a whole lot of stylish tennis shoes around the house, so I used to want a lot of sneakers,\" Big Boi said, explaining that he started making up for lost time -- and shoes -- long before OutKast's 1994 debut, \"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik.\" Juan Castaneda, 27, also grew up in a family of modest means and longed to don the fresh kicks he saw his peers wearing. \"When I got money to buy them, I started catching up,\" said Castaneda, who works at a nursing home in Hendersonville, North Carolina. He estimates he owns about 200 pairs of sneakers, including a pair of Nike Air Jordan XIs with patent-leather trim called \"Space Jams.\" They cost him $500. It's supply and demand at its simplest, said Elliott Curtis, a former Carnegie Mellon University basketball player who for two semesters taught Sneakerology 101, billed as the first accredited class on sneaker culture. Shoe companies create a limited number (say, a few hundred pairs) of shoes -- even if it's just an old model with new colors or materials -- and demand automatically spikes. \"It's like a status symbol. If Nike is selling a shoe for $2,000, they're not expecting to sell that many,\" the recent graduate said, adding that sneakerheads are drawn to scarcity. \"If they've got money, they can buy coolness,\" Curtis said. Curtis goes to garage sales and mom-and-pop stores seeking rare and retro sneakers for his 75-pair collection, but he concedes he's waited in line for limited editions and paid as much as $250 for a pair. Sporting an ultra-rare set of blue-and-red \"Bugs Bunny\" Nike Air Jordan VIIIs, Big Boi said he today boasts at least 400 pairs of sneakers, but he rarely pays for them because shoe companies send him pairs. His most expensive, a pair of crocodile-skin Nike Air Force 1s, sell on various auction sites for up to $1,800. Big Boi has never worn them, but he plans on taking them out of their Nike lockbox this summer so he can wear them in a video for his upcoming solo album. To Peter Fahey, the mastermind behind Sneaker Pimps shoe shows, Big Boi's enthusiasm is typical. Sneaker culture got its start in New York in the 1970s, mostly among playground streetballers and practitioners of an emerging genre of music called hip-hop. Over the next three decades, rappers and basketball players -- most notably, Run DMC and Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan -- would play integral roles in boosting the popularity of rare kicks. \"Run DMC were probably at the height of the whole movement. It was the first time music and sneakers crossed like this,\" Fahey said of the group's 1986 hit, \"My Adidas.\" Today, Adidas, Nike and Puma compete with luxury brands such as Chanel, Prada and Gucci. The major sports shoe companies also allow customers to design their own shoes. Upstarts such as San Francisco's JB Classics and Japan's Madfoot and KKOK have snatched up market share as well. Shoe companies realize hip-hop's influence and work hard to get \"a fresh pair of steps\" on a rapper's feet. Earlier this year, Converse released a line of its iconic All-Stars in tandem with Chicago rhymesmith Lupe Fiasco. Nike has issued two versions of the Air Yeezy, inspired by rapper-producer Kanye West. Louis Vuitton also has teamed up with West. Some lines, such as the Yeezys, quickly become collectors' items. Die-hard sneakerheads keep them in their original boxes like \"Star Wars\" action figures and ferret them away in closets, their soles never to be scuffed by a sidewalk. Bryan Lyle, 22, of Stockbridge, Georgia, said he recently camped out three nights at an Atlanta boutique to get one of the shop's eight pairs of Air Yeezys. Lyle paid $300, a small fortune for shoes, but Castaneda said the price more than doubled within days. He got a pair of Yeezys from an eBay merchant in Hong Kong. The damage? $700. Melissa Bailey of Hendersonville, North Carolina, takes photos at the Sneaker Pimps show. Castaneda's girlfriend, Melissa Bailey, 26, said Castaneda actually bought three pairs. He found two online and paid someone to camp out for the others. Castaneda's modus operandi is to buy three pairs of his favorite shoes -- one to wear, one to store for later and one to sell or trade, she said. \"He will not walk through grass. He will not walk through dirt,\" Bailey said. For the last six years, Fahey has had a front-row seat for the evolution of sneaker culture. He held the first Sneaker Pimps show in Sydney, Australia, in 2003, but only 200 people showed up, belying the trend's rising popularity. Soon, however, tens of thousands would attend shows in more than 60 cities. A 2006 show in Jakarta, Indonesia, drew about 13,000 sneakerheads. The shows now feature between 1,000 and 1,500 shoes. Some are rare. Others are signed by celebrities. Hip-hop acts are a staple, as is artwork -- on both kicks and canvas. At this month's show, hundreds of sneaker enthusiasts filed through Atlanta's Tabernacle with the decorum of museum patrons, stopping to admire the shoes displayed on swaths of chain-link fence. There were novice sneakerheads, such as Chris Shepherd, 20, and Charnelle Cook, 20, an Atlanta couple who marveled over the DC Comics and Transformers sneakers. Asked about her multicolored hightops, Cook said, \"I couldn't tell you what these are called. All I know is they're Reeboks, and they're fly.\" There were seasoned collectors, such as Kyle Self, 35, of Decatur, Georgia, who said he had about 25 pairs, some of them still in their boxes. Included in the group are three pairs of $400 low-top Pradas, which he called his \"everyday sneakers.\" There were even female collectors, such as artist Estasha Goodwin, 23, who modeled a pair of shimmering gold, winged -- yes, winged -- hightops made by Adidas and designer Jeremy Scott. She complained that shoe companies too often focus on the male market and ignored female aficionados. \"When they do cater to us, it's always bubblegum pink. They don't even make them in our sizes,\" she said. \"I know women who know more about sneakers than any dude out here today.\" Incidentally, her favorite of the 15 pairs she owns were made for men -- the Nike \"Ace of Spades\" Dunks, inspired by the Detroit Tigers' high-kicking pitcher, Dontrelle Willis, who is prominently featured on the black-and-aqua shoe's hightop. Asked why she shelled out $250 for them, she gave a familiar response: \"It's a feeling you get when you know you're the only one that has something. Even if you're not, it's the way you walk it.\"",

Craig Revel Horwood has revealed how he owes his success to a \u2018sugar daddy\u2019 lover he met when he was just 17. The Strictly Come Dancing judge said the 43-year-old man paid for his dance lessons and helped kick-start his television career in return for \u2018doing the dirty\u2019. Revel Horwood, known for his acerbic comments on the BBC1 show, said the nature of the relationship meant he had previously been described by some as a \u2018rent boy\u2019. Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood has revealed how he owes his success to a 'sugar daddy' lover he met when he was just 17. Right, the dancer at 18 years old . The dancer made the revelations last night at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, where he also disclosed he is to undergo hip surgery in two weeks\u2019 time. In a wide-ranging interview, he also discussed how celebrities found it uncomfortable to be \u2018flung about by dancers\u2019 on the popular show. Discussing his relationship with the older man, Revel Horwood, 48, said he was approached while he was living in his native Australia as a teenager. Describing him as \u2018Mr X\u2019 for legal reasons, Revel Horwood said: \u2018It was this man who was 43 and I was 17. \u2018He said I will pay for your classes but you come away with me and we do the dirty. \u2018I suppose that could be compared to a lady getting engaged and getting a great big sparkling Tiffany ring \u2013 and then breaking off the engagement but keeping the ring.\u2019 At the time, Revel Horwood had left school and was training as a chef, but said he \u2018hated\u2019 it, adding that Mr X \u2018saved me from that\u2019. Revel Horwood has become known for his acerbic comments on BBC1 show Strictly Come Dancing . However, Revel Horwood did not divulge any further details of the relationship and quickly moved on to other subjects. Talking about his imminent hip surgery, Revel Horwood said it would clash with filming for the current series. He said: \u2018I\u2019m going in at six o\u2019clock in the morning on Sunday after filming Saturday night live. \u2018I will be watching myself on the telly . on Sunday night [the results show screened on Sunday is filmed on . Saturday night] with my old hip and I\u2019ll have a new one in.\u2019 He added: . \u2018I will be made of titanium and I can\u2019t wait, darling.\u2019 Asked whether he would be fit to return to the show the following week, he said he might have to face the cameras and the audience in a wheelchair, adding: \u2018A fabulous glittery one I hope.\u2019 He also revealed how celebrities found it difficult being \u2018manhandled\u2019. \u2018Sometimes you throw a girl up and she will fart and come back down,\u2019 he joked. In his latest book, Tales From the Dance Floor, Revel Horwood wrote about how fellow Strictly judge Darcey Bussell breaks wind on set. Last night he said he had not warned her before the book was published \u2013 and the first thing she said to him when she saw him after reading it was, \u2018Fart?\u2019 But he added she had taken it well and spent the entire night\u2019s filming leaning to one side and pretending to break wind. \u2018We were in stitches,\u2019 he said.",

The collision happened Thursday morning but news of the disaster is only just emerging. Eugene Kabambi, a WHO spokesman in the country's capital, Kinshasa, told CNN that the wreck occurred at a resort downstream of the town of Kwamouth, when an overloaded barge en route to Inongo collided with a boat carrying 150 people. \"We are searching for as many as 100 people in the Congo River as well as assisting these people with body bags, medical kit,\" said Kabambi. \"One of the boats was totally destroyed and that is the one we believe was carrying the missing.\" Kabambi said his team had been told Friday by the provincial minister of transportation and infrastructure that there were 100 passengers in total and that 42 people had been rescued. However, WHO believes the number of passengers to be close to 150, based on survivors' accounts. A WHO statement released Friday said three bodies had been recovered from the river so far. No passenger manifest was available so it's difficult to establish the total number of people on board the privately owned vessel, it said. No one is thought to have been injured on the barge. The accident is believed to have been caused by powerful currents near the Ngobila rapids. According to WHO, which was awaiting a delivery of medical supplies and body bags to the area Saturday, overloaded barges and passenger boats frequently sink in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the Congo River and on the country's lakes. This is usually owing to the age of the vessels and failure to follow rules of navigation.",

UPDATED: . 09:15 EST, 6 June 2013 . Pub regulars are to be given the . chance to buy and run their local as David Cameron unveiled a . \u00a3250million fund to stop community facilities closing down. The Prime Minister said he wanted local people to be able to own shops, village halls, playing fields and even swimming pools. Mr . Cameron insisted he had not given up on his often-mocked Big Society . vision, and vowed to \u2018fight\u2019 opponents who refused to back him. Cheers: David Cameron, pictured leaving outside Number 10 today with comedian David Walliams and the Enough Food for Everyone IF campaign, used a speech to announce \u00a3250million to buy shops and pubs by 2020 . Money from dormant bank accounts has helped to swell the coffers of Big Society Capital which is bankrolling the idea for a decade, with funding from the Big Lottery Fund. In a speech on social investment funds, Mr Cameron said \u00a3250million would be available until 2020 to \u2018help communities with ambitions to own local assets like pubs, shops, community centres and affordable housing\u2019. The money \u2013 paid out in grants or loans \u2013 will help people in towns, villages and cities to buy and run facilities which are no longer financially viable as a business. Some of the money from the lottery fund will go into grants to support projects which cannot be expected to turn a profit. But \u00a350 million of the money will go into a community asset fund to provide grants and loans to help get projects off the ground which could go on to be commercially viable over the long term. Mr Cameron said: \u2018Everyone knows how vital institutions in our towns and villages are, like village halls, playing fields, local pubs. \u2018And everyone knows how - despite the best efforts of parish and local councils - these can face closure.\u2019 Dream: Pub locals would be able to run their local if it closes down while residents could buy playing fields to stop them being developed . He insisted that using public money to help people to take over and run pubs and shops was not \u2018some pipe dream\u2019. \u2018Already there are 311 community-owned shops,18 community-owned pubs, as well as community owned bookshops, cafes, swimming pools, bakers, farmers markets, even community owned broadband networks,\u2019 he added. He highlighted Fenham Swimming pool in Newcastle, which was closed by Newcastle City Council in 2003. It was saved by a community group but it came under financial pressure. Investment from Big Society Capital meant they were able to install solar panels to heat the pool, reduce their running costs and make it financially viable as a community centre. Mr Cameron said he hoped that the new funding will mean that \u2018projects like this will be possible not in just in one community \u2013 but in every community across the country\u2019. Splash: Mr Cameron praised Fenham swimming pool in Newcastle, which was saved by local people after being shut by the local council . Speaking to a Social Impact Investment Forum staged in London as part of the UK's chairmanship of the G8, Mr Cameron also announced a consultation on new tax breaks for social enterprises. And he welcomed the launch, supported by the London Stock Exchange, of the world's first social stock exchange, which will showcase social impact businesses and provide a means for potential investors to measure their success. The Prime Minister launched a staunch defence of the Big Society, which formed the centrepiece of his leadership in opposition but appeared to have been quietly shelved after the financial crash. Tory strategists have said the focus must be on the economy, immigration and welfare. But Mr Cameron defied his critics \u2013 including many in the Conservative party \u2013 to signal that the Big Society will remain a key feature of his premiership. \u2018Some people occasionally ask me whether I still believe with the same passion in the vision of building a bigger and stronger society. I'm absolutely prepared to fight for this. Social investment can be a great force for social change, it can help us to build the bigger and stronger societies we want to see.",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\nA daughter who fled with her mother a decade ago during a custody dispute must appear in court if she is to testify in her mother's defence - but she is in hiding and it's not clear if she will come forward. A lawyer acting for Genevieve Kelly had requested that her daughter Mary Nunes, now 18, be allowed to give a videotaped testimony in her mother's trial on custodial interference charges. But the judge in the case yesterday rejected the request, ruling that Miss Nunes needs to be questioned by prosecutors first, because the state has no idea what she is planning to testify. Genevieve Kelley (left, before she fled in 2004) returned to New Hampshire late last year (right) and is facing custodial interference charges for taking her daughter Mary Nunes . The whereabouts of Mary Nunes (left in childhood) are still unknown, though authorities have issued age-progressed photos (right) to try and find the now 18-year-old . Miss Nunes was eight when she fled with her mother from Lancaster, New Hampshire. Kelley turned herself in to authorities in November on custodial interference charges. She said she wants a trial, and her lawyer said Ms Nunes plans to testify for her mother. But Alan Rosenfeld, for Kelly, had asked that Miss Nunes's testimony be videotaped, saying she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2004 and would suffer mental or emotional strain if she has to testify in court. Prosecutor John McCormick responded that while the state is sensitive to the well-being of Ms Nunes, if she is going to be a witness, she should appear at trial, not as part of a 'packaged videotaped presentation.' Judge Peter Bornstein, ruling that Ms Nunes should not be allowed to give video-taped testimony, said he had no evidence that the diagnosis from 2004 would affect her today, and that even if there were evidence, 'it's so remote in time.' When asked how he would find Ms Nunes, Mr McCormick said, 'That's a good question.' He said he hoped the defence would help arrange the meeting. Since their disappearance ten years ago, U.S. Marshals have searched in the US, Canada and Central America for the daughter, mother and her new husband Scott Kelley. The mother said she violated a family court decision to protect her daughter from her ex-husband, Dr Mark Nunes, whom she alleges sexually abused the child. The father was investigated, but not charged. Authorities felt the man was unfairly accused. Scott Kelley, 50, \u00a0is also wanted in the case of Mary Nunes's non-custodial kidnapping . Law enforcement concluded that Mrs Kelley mistreated the child. Kelley and Dr Nunes divorced in 1998 and the mother moved to back to the northern town New Hampshire town where her parents lived. The couple communicated through a notebook that Mary would shuttle back and forth, before a visit to her father's house was cancelled in 2003. Kelley said she fled during the custody battle over Mary to avoid a greater harm to her child, but prosecutor John McCormick said that defense doesn't apply under state law. The prosecutor says the protection defense only applies if Mrs Kelley had stayed in New Hampshire with the girl. Mr Rosenfeld said the law is meant to prevent that defense from being available to parents who take children out of state as part of an alleged crime. The protection defense is one of many motions Justice Peter Bornstein is likely to hear today. Ms Kelley's lawyers, who specialize in cases involving mothers kidnapping their children amid abuse allegations, have also asked that the judge not decide whether to allow her defenses until after evidence is heard, according to the Union Leader. Mr Rosenfeld said it would be up to prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mrs Kelley left after no longer having a legal right to do so. The defendant was not present for the hearing that gave Dr Nunes custody of Mary. The lawyer said Ms Kelley plans to offer testimony that at a point where her daughter's court-appointed guardian and social service agencies 'had chosen not to believe' what the girl said, the legal system was unable to protect her. 'Simply put, there was no lawful alternative to provide safety for this child,' he wrote. Mr McCormick said the investigation into whether Mary was abused was 'greatly compromised' by Mrs Kelley's actions. He said because Ms Kelley intentionally refused to follow the court's order for Mary to be evaluated in 2004, 'she all but sabotaged the prospect of ever bringing Mary's alleged abuser to justice'. US Marshals say that Mrs Kelley and her daughter originally fled on their own passports and made a stop in Honduras or Guatemala. The Friends of Genevieve Kelley group helped post the mother's $250,000 bail after she returned to New Hampshire to face trial . The girl is no longer subject to family court after reaching the age of majority, and Mrs Kelley made contact with authorities last spring. Mrs Kelley said that she returned because her nine-year-old son needs medical treatment for cystic fibrosis, according to the\u00a0Boston Globe . The defense lawyer says that the daughter is anxious to return to living with her Mrs Kelley after the trial is resolved. Dr Nunes, who is remarried and lives in Ohio, issued a statement saying that his daughter 'has been told falsehoods and misstatements on the events of her youth'. Mrs Kelley, a family practice doctor, is thought to have stopped in Honduras or Guatemala after fleeing New Hampshire . Ms Kelley was released from jail on January 7 after supporters posted $250,000 cash bail, and is living with her son. The defendant is not allowed to have contact with her daughter or with her husband, 50-year-old Scott Kelley, who also is missing and is charged with custodial interference. He remains as one of New Hampshire's most wanted. The prosecutor has asked for access to Ms Kelley's passport in hopes of locating her daughter. Mr Rosenfeld objected, saying she would be producing evidence against herself, in violation of her constitutional rights against self-incrimination. The mother was released from custody after posting bail and is now living in New Hampshire with her nine-year-old son .",

'Just picture this - Amal, that foul-mouthed, red-haired, talkaholic, opinionated, phone-addicted, weed-smoking kaffir playing the dutiful Burka-clad (woman) cooking around the camp fire in Syria. 'If a jury in this court in its 200 years has been invited to swallow a more preposterous proposition, I personally would have paid good money to see it.' El-Wahabi put her hand over her mouth as she laughed at his comments from the dock. Mr Summers went on: 'Added to these unsuitable jihadist personality traits is selfishness. Everything that Amal says and does is about her. She wouldn't even attend a charity event if she couldn't get in free.' Courier: Msaad was stopped by police at Heathrow in January before she boarded a flight. She handed over the rolled up notes hidden in her undergarments, the Old Bailey (pictured) heard. He also said that Hamza, 30, who the court previously heard was a drug dealer who was regularly in trouble with police, was involved in 'drugs, drugs and more drugs'. Mr Summers told the jury of five men and seven women it would need to answer two questions as it deliberated its verdicts, the first being whether Hamza is a terrorist. 'If you're not sure that he's a terrorist, then it follows that you can't be sure that the money was for terrorism,' he said. 'Two: even if you answer question one in the affirmative you also have to be sure that Amal knew he was a terrorist. If she did not then it follows that she could not have believed that the money was for terrorism. 'Even if Davis (AKA Hamza) was a terrorist and Amal knew it, it still does not inevitably follow that terrorism was the target for the money.' Mr Summers said El-Wahabi 'clearly was intending' to take her two young children to live in Turkey and that was what the money was to go towards. 'That's what she was telling people at the time,' he said. 'She hasn't made it up - it's there in her messages.' El-Wahabi and Msaad both deny a charge of funding terrorism.

Goodall spoke exclusively to CNN in a Panamanian rain forest where she is exploring a partnership on behalf of Roots & Shoots, her global youth education program. The interview comes as a new version of the song, first released on Jackson's 1991 \"Dangerous\" album, is being recorded by a collection of artists for release in late October. Goodall became friends with Jackson about 20 years ago when he invited her to his Neverland Ranch, where \"he talked about his dreams for the place to have animals running, looking free like they would in the wild. ... It was just a very charming day, very low key, nobody else was there,\" she said. Goodall, famous for her 50 years of groundbreaking research on chimpanzees in Africa, said Jackson invited her because \"he loved what I did.\" \"He loved chimpanzees,\" she said. \"He loved to watch them feeding. He liked their faces. They made him smile.\" Years later, she met Jackson's chimp, Bubbles, and has visited him at his retirement refuge in Florida, she said. \"He's extremely handsome,\" she said. \"He's a beautiful, beautiful chimp. So, he was rescued in time from this life of being inappropriately dressed up and carted around like a little symbol.\" Goodall, whose life has been spent understanding chimpanzees, said she found Jackson to be \"a sad person.\" \"In some ways, he was like a child, and a very sweet and gentle child, and he wanted me to tell him many, many stories,\" she said. \"Stories about the chimpanzees, the forests, animals, anything. He told me he liked the way I told stories.\" Goodall, who travels the world to promote protection of endangered chimps, said she had hoped Jackson would help get her message out. \"I said to him, 'You know, Michael, if you want to help, you could do a concert and give us a percentage. Or much better, write a song,' \" she said. Jackson asked her for tapes of animals in distress because \"he wanted to be angry and cry\" as he wrote the song, which became \"Heal the World,\" she said. The original CD cover notes credited Goodall for inspiring the song, she said. But, she added, the Jane Goodall Institute never saw any money from the song. Jackson later created the \"Heal the World Foundation,\" which he funded with a series of concerts. The group delivered millions of dollars of relief to children around the world.",

A three-year-old girl suffers from a rare disease that means going on a summer holiday could kill her. Isla Todd has lymphoedema, a condition that causes swelling in the body's tissue. It usually affects the arms and legs and can lead to pain and a loss of mobility. The condition is caused by damage or disruption to the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from tissues. In patients such as Isla, the excess fluid will cause the tissue to swell. Her lower legs are constantly swollen and any cut or infection could be deadly. This means high temperatures, grazes or insect bites can be fatal, her mother Heather says. As a result, she and husband Andrew cannot take their daughter on a family holiday to Spain because of the temperature, and Isla isn't allowed to run around in the park like other children. Secondary lymphoedema is a well-known side effect of chemotherapy, which can damage the lymph nodes. However Isla, from Glasgow, is thought to be the only child in Scotland born with the condition. Her mother, 45, said: 'We have to be so careful with Isla so she doesn\u2019t get the slightest knock. 'If we were to go to somewhere like Spain, the temperature increase would increase the swelling in her legs and that would be deadly. 'Also there\u2019s more chance of her being bitten by an insect out there. 'She\u2019s never been barefoot because any slight cut or graze means we have to rush her straight to hospital. 'Whenever she runs around my heart is in my mouth.' The lymphoedema means Isla's lymphatic system, which helps regulate the body\u2019s immune system, hasn\u2019t fully developed below her knees. If she is cut, a circle has to be drawn around the mark to monitor the infections growth for cellulitis - a serious bacterial infection. She also wears protective stockings . and her mother always carries a first aid kit - complete with . anti-bacterial medicines and a special pen - in case anything happens. It took nine months for Isla to be diagnosed - despite her being born two weeks early with severely swollen legs. Mrs Todd said: 'The nurses panicked as soon as Isla was delivered - they could see something was wrong. The condition is caused by damage or disruption to the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from tissues. In patients such as Isla, the excess fluid means her legs are constantly swollen and any cut or infection could be fatal . Isla also wears protective stockings and her mother, Heather, always carries a first aid kit - complete with anti-bacterial medicines - in case anything happens . 'She was two weeks early but still weighed 9lbs and her feet and legs were really swollen. 'I don\u2019t think anyone had seen it before.' The University of Glasgow is home of the UK\u2019s longest serving lymphoedema programme and staff there work closely with Isla and her family. A spokeswoman for the university said: 'We believe Isla is the only child to be born in Scotland with the condition. 'Most of the time people get secondary lymphoedema, but this is usually a result of their lymph nodes being damage from cancer treatment. Isla's parents are fundraising for the Lymphoedema Support Network to help find a cure. Lymphoedema is a rare condition that causes . swelling in the body's tissue. It usually affects the arms and legs and . can lead to pain and a loss of mobility. The condition is caused by damage or disruption to the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from tissues. Damage means the excess fluid cannot be returned to the circulatory system, causing the tissue to swell. There are two main types of lymphoedema: . Primary lymphoedema \u2013 which develops at birth or shortly after puberty and is caused by faulty genes. Secondary lymphoedema \u2013 caused by damage to the lymphatic system as a result of an infection, injury, trauma, or cancer. The latter often develops as a side effect of cancer treatment. Surgery is often necessary to remove lymph glands to prevent a cancer . from spreading, this can damage the lymphatic system. It is estimated that 1 in 10,000 people are affected by primary lymphoedema. Secondary lymphoedema is a relatively common condition, affecting an estimated 100,000 people in the UK.",

The global body said almost $2.5 billion is needed to cope with the crisis. So far, it has only received 48% of that and is lacking $1.2 billion. For Somalia, where the United Nations has declared famine in five southern regions, the United Nations has received about half of the roughly $1 billion needed. \"There's been an initial response but it needs to be sustained and we are still far short of the $1 billion target that we set ourselves with some very worrying gaps,\" said Mark Bowden, the U.N. coordinator for Somalia. Impact Your World: How you can help . Bowden said the United Nations will have to go back to donors and ask for more food. But the health sector is also an area of concern. \"What happens during famine is that people die of epidemic diseases like measles and malaria ... and if we can't support health activities then we will lose a lot of lives unnecessarily.\" \"We're worried that people are going to die in the next month or so and inevitably more areas will slip in to famine conditions,\" he said. The situation is particularly grave in southern Somalia, where almost 3 million people are in need of immediate assistance. In Mogadishu, U.N. agencies are assessing their ability to scale up operations after the militant Islamic group Al-Shabaab announced a withdrawal from the war-torn capital. But U.N. officials have said it is too early to gauge the consequences of the Al-Shabaab pullout. Aid continues to reach Mogadishu by sea and air, but supplies are low. In Al-Shabaab's absence, more Somalis have found the courage to defy the group's ban on foreign aid and seek refuge in government held areas. Saacid, a local aid group that runs a children's feeding center, fed 18,000 children last month. This month, it's expecting to see 25,000 children. At Banadiir Hospital, which houses Somalia's largest children's ward, the doctors work without electricity or running water. They are even running out of the saline drips used to rehydrate the malnourished. Luwal Mohamed, the doctor in charge, said supplies are so scant that it's easier to count what the hospital has rather than what it doesn't. \"The supplies that are missing is the essential equipment for lifesaving like oxygen machines, monitoring, blood pressure measurements, stethoscopes,\" Mohamed said. The United States announced Thursday an additional $17 million for the crisis, with $12 million designated for Somalia. The U.S. money is on top of the $105 million in emergency funding President Barack Obama announced Monday. \"What is happening in the Horn of Africa is the most severe humanitarian emergency in the world today and the worst that East Africa has seen in several decades,\" said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Meanwhile, the Somali Football Federation lauded a $1 million donation from the governing body of international soccer. \"The FIFA humanitarian response shows that the world football governing body is not only confined to promoting football development in the lawless country, but also FIFA is playing a very big role in saving the vulnerable Somalis including some displaced by wars and draughts and some disabled by the long-exciting civil strife in the country,\" said a statement from the Somali federation. The United Nations expects the Horn of Africa emergency to persist for several months and the number of people needing help to go up by 25%. CNN's Nima Elbagir reported from Mogadishu and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta.",

Their 2-0 win over Manchester City could well be a watershed moment in the Gunners' stuttering season. But what was different about Arsene Wenger's side at the Etihad Stadium and what lessons can they learn going into future clashes against their direct rivals? Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger got his side's tactics spot on as they won 2-0 away at Manchester City . 1) DISCIPLINE AND CONCENTRATION . Throwing away leads in search of more goals has been an unwanted characteristic of Arsenal's season so far. Conceding a 3-0 lead against Anderlecht in the Champions League has been one of the low-lights of their campaign. But there was no gung-ho approach against City. Having taken the lead through Santi Cazorla's penalty, the Gunners were much more conservative, remaining compact, not trying to stretch the game as they stifled City's attack. Santi Cazorla's first half penalty gave Arsenal a platform to build upon in Sunday's 2-0 win at the Etihad . The diminutive Spain international (left) celebrates his opener with Olivier Giroud (centre) and Alexis Sanchez . 2) KILLING THE GAME . It's not, perhaps, in keeping with Arsenal's attacking mantra but they showed guile and know-how of getting over the line at the Etihad. Time wasting in the corners, passing the ball sideways and backwards all wastes valuable seconds when you are ahead in a game. We don't usually see Arsenal lower themselves to that sort of thing. But they did on Sunday and came away with the best win of the season so far. Lesson learned. Arsenal's second goalscorer  Giroud (centre) held the ball up well as the visitors closed the game out . 3) FRANCIS COQUELIN - MIDFIELD ENFORCER . Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out defensive midfielder all season. It looks like they have found one in Coquelin. The young Frenchman was instrumental against City. Breaking up play in midfield and passing the ball to those who can do damage. Whether Coquelin is the answer to the Gunners midfield conundrum in the long term remains to be seen. But, for the time being, Wenger looks to have the midfield enforcer he has been desperate for. Francis Coquelin (centre) had an excellent game in midfield for the Gunners protecting the defence . 4) MIXING IT UP . We all know Arsenal can pass the ball as well as most teams in Europe, but they showed a different side to their game on Sunday. Goalkeeper David Ospina's long balls into centre forward Olivier Giroud was a feature of the Gunners' game plan. Is it a shame Wenger's side were forced to part with their passing principles? Perhaps. But Arsenal supporters certainly won't be concerned about that this morning. David Ospina's (left) long balls into Giroud were one asset of an astute tactical plan deployed by Arsenal . 5) HAPPY NOT TO HAVE THE BALL . Arsenal are most comfortable with the ball at their feet; when they dictating play. But on Sunday they had just 35 per cent of possession - but came away with a 2-0 win. Figure that one out? You don't always have to control the pace of a game to win it, as the Gunners proved as they stifled City's attack. They showed efficiency in their counter-attacks against Manuel Pellegrini's side. They had three shots on target - two of which were goals. Gunners used the counter-attack to good effect against City - with Sanchez (left) a key weapon on the break .",

A mother-of-two lost almost 11st in weight after she discovered she was too large to wear an airliner seat belt. Donna McKenna, 32, was jetting off to Gran Canaria for a summer break when, to her horror, she found she could not stretch the regular-sized safety belt across her lap as the plane prepared to take off. Mrs McKenna, of Portsmouth, was forced to endure the humiliation of being fitted for a brightly-coloured extra-large belt extension by a flight attendant. Following the birth of her son Ryan in 2008, Donna found it even more difficult to control her weight gain and before long her health was beginning to suffer . Donna began dieting, bringing her weight down from the 22st 7lb she was at her heaviest to the 11st 8lb . Stung by the experience, Mrs McKenna began dieting, bringing her weight down from the 22st 7lb she was at her heaviest to the 11st 8lb she is today. Last week she returned from a holiday in Turkey where she was able to wear her bikini with pride in the wake of her amazing transformation. Mrs McKenna, a children\u2019s nursery receptionist, said: 'The seatbelt extension was bright orange and the attendants were having to make a fuss of me. I felt as if all eyes were on me - it was a horrible feeling. 'Once we . got to the Canary Islands, the holiday was miserable, too.. I was barely . brave enough to venture outside of the hotel room and I certainly . didn\u2019t want to go anywhere near the swimming pool.' Mrs . McKenna saw her weight increase as she settled into a comfortable life . with her childhood sweetheart Neil, 31, a supermarket manager, whom she . met when she was a teenager. She . said: 'Life was very easy-going. We didn\u2019t shy away from having treats - . I was particularly drawn to crisps and chocolate. By the time we . married in 2006, I was 17st' Mrs McKenna saw her weight increase as she settled into a comfortable life with her childhood sweetheart, Neil . By the time Donna and Neil got married in 2006 her weight had already reached 17st . Donna decided she had to tackle her weight when the family took a trip to  the Canary Islands and she had to have a special seat belt because of her size . Donna used to eat a cheese pizza with chips and a packet of crisps for lunch, with a ready-meal of spaghetti carbonara for an evening meal . Following the birth of the couple\u2019s son Ryan in 2008, she found it even more difficult to control her weight gain and before long her health was beginning to suffer. She said: 'I started to struggle with mobility. Ryan was always very active and it was difficult keeping up with him. It became Neil\u2019s job to take him to the park. 'It was a shame to go to the park and not be able to go on the swings with him, like any other mum. I began to feel quite sad and guilty about that. 'When I felt bad I would go home and comfort eat, which made me get larger, so it became a vicious circle.' Now, at 11st 8lb and wearing size 10 clothing, she is at the lowest weight she has ever been in adulthood . In the summer of 2010, when she was four months pregnant with her daughter Isabelle, now three, Mrs McKenna was at her largest size, weighing 22st 7lb and wearing size 26 clothing. It was then that the family decided to have a holiday to the Canary Islands, which involved a short flight. Mrs McKenna said: 'I tried to get comfortable in the plane seat but I struggled to fit into it. 'I might have been four months pregnant, but I knew I should have been able to fit into the chair anyway. 'In that moment I knew I had to do something. 'I waited for a while - until Isabelle was six weeks old - before I started to diet properly. But from then on, I\u2019d committed to making a change.' Mrs McKenna joined her local branch of Slimming World and within the first week she had lost five pounds. Over the course of a year she lost nearly seven stone. She said: 'I was so nervous before the first class. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that my mum Christine was with me for moral support, I don\u2019t think I would have got through the door. 'After all that worry, they were a really nice group and they made me feel welcome. I got loads of support from them. 'Changing my diet so dramatically took quite a lot of getting my head around, but once you figure out what you\u2019re doing and start to see the results, it\u2019s easy. Success really spurs you on for the following week.' Before beginning her weight loss journey, Mrs McKenna typically ate nothing for breakfast, followed by a cheese pizza with chips and a packet of crisps for lunch, with a ready-meal of spaghetti carbonara for an evening meal. Throughout the day she would snack on crisps and Galaxy chocolate. Today, she typically enjoys scrambled egg or a serving of Bran Flakes for breakfast, followed by chicken or ham salad for lunch, with lean chicken and steamed vegetables for an evening meal. When she snacks, she enjoys bananas and apples. Now, at 11st 8lb and wearing size 10 clothing, she is at the lowest weight she has ever been in adulthood. Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Cheese pizza with chips and crisps . Dinner: Ready-meal of spaghetti carbonara . Snacks: Crisps and chocolate . Breakfast: Scrambled eggs or bran flakes . Lunch: Chicken or ham sandwich . Dinner: Lean chicken and vegetables . Snacks: Bananas and apples . She said: 'Neil\u2019s extremely proud and full of praise. He\u2019s hugely encouraging. 'It\u2019s easier to keep up with Ryan and Isabelle. Ryan loves running around with me - he remembers me as I was before and loves seeing his mum so healthy and with such energy.' Last week, Mrs McKenna returned from a triumphant family holiday to Turkey, where she was able to enjoy the beachside with full body confidence. She said: 'I was able to get into a bikini. It was so nice to be able to do that. It felt amazing to think that no-one was looking at me. 'As I was boarding the plane at the start of the holiday, I had a flashback to the time when I couldn\u2019t stretch the seat belt across me. This time, as I pulled the seatbelt across, I had to pull it tighter as it was left too big from the previous passenger.

Conway confirmed the arrangement. The NFL initiated an investigation into Favre's actions after the sports website Deadspin.com reported in August that the athlete sent voice messages, texts and pictures of his penis to Sterger in 2008, when he was the Jets' quarterback and she was working for the team as a sideline personality and host. Deadspin reported Wednesday that Milton E. Ahlerich, a vice president in the league's security department, asked Deadspin Editor A.J. Daulerio -- who wrote the Favre stories -- to meet \"to determine the possibility of you sharing any and all details you and your media organization may have on this matter.\" Daulerio said in a website posting that he told Ahlerich he would \"be willing to cooperate with the NFL's thorough investigation into Brett Favre's sexting habits,\" but would not divulge his source for the original story. \"I told Mr. Ahlerich that any and all information we have to offer is available on the site and that I'm unwilling to give anything more than that right now. To this, he responded that he's read over what has been on the site many, many times, meaning this poor man ... has been looking at penis pictures for close to a week. Pity him.\" Daulerio said Ahlerich also told him he met Tuesday with Favre and that the meeting was \"even-handed\" and that the parties involved were \"well-represented.\" Daulerio has acknowledged that third-party sources were paid for the story about Sterger and that he could not say definitively that the messages or photos the site posted came from the 41-year-old quarterback. Ahlerich did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday. Favre has not publicly addressed the investigation. Asked Wednesday why he had not denied the stories, he told a reporter, \"That's something that's within the league and I just have to leave it at that.\" Sterger, 26, is co-host of \"The Daily Line,\" a sports program on Versus, a sports cable television channel. The Jets have given National Football League officials all the information they have regarding the incident, a team spokesman said last week. Jesse Derris, a spokesman for the Jets, told HLN's \"Prime News\" that the team has no role in the allegations against Favre, who played one season in New York and now plays for the Minnesota Vikings. Favre, who has been married for 14 years, signed with the Minnesota Vikings in August 2009 after emerging from retirement for the second time in as many years. Deadspin has also reported that a second woman has come forward to allege that she received other lewd messages from the quarterback and that a third woman, whom the site did not identify, also received similar messages. The site reported the two women were massage therapists hired by the Jets, and identified them only by pseudonyms. Derris said the therapists were hired for two days in the team's 2008 training camp and would not confirm whether they had any direct contact with Favre. CNN could not independently confirm whether the voice in the recordings belongs to Favre, or whether he sent the notes. Favre played most of his career with the Green Bay Packers, leading the team to a Super Bowl title in 1997. He was traded to the Jets after the 2007 season.",

Harrison Ford has been airlifted to hospital after the Millennium Falcon spaceship crushed his ankle in an accident on the set of the latest Star Wars film. The actor, 71, clutched his chest in pain as crew members rushed to free him from underneath the prop's hydraulic door, a source revealed. He was then stretchered off set and flown to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, which specialises in fractures. Producers are now hastily rescheduling shoots to allow for what could be a lengthy absence for the actor. The incident, at the start of an evening shoot in Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, last night, came just days after fans learned the Millennium Falcon ship - piloted by Ford's character Han Solo - would appear in the new film. Reprising his buccaneering role from the early films for Star Wars: Episode VII, it is believed Ford was about to start a scene involving the 111ft vehicle. 'Harris was hit by the door and looked in a bad way and was clutching his chest when he was on the stretcher,' a source told The Mirror. The source added that he was in 'a lot of pain' and his foot appeared 'damaged'. Ford is now recovering in the trauma unit of the hospital. It is thought he fractured his ankle and is awaiting results of further tests to see if he suffered injuries to his chest. But while the actor's agent refuses to release any details of his condition, one staff member on the specialist unit could not resist tweeting about her star patient. The nurse - who calls herself Blonde Miss Bond - sparked a probe when she posted a public tweet saying: 'Surreal experience to have Harrison Ford's medical notes in the office.' The medic, who states on her Twitter account that she lives in Oxford and Podgorica in Montenegro, has now set her page to private. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We would have to verify the tweet and we would look into it.' A source told the Hollywood Reporter that Ford had been injured by the door of the Millennium Falcon.

When it was rumoured that Ford may take part in a fifth Indiana Jones film last year, the American actor shrugged of accusations he is too old to take on the action role. He said: \u2018I don\u2019t think there is any barrier to Indiana Jones being an old fart. I\u2019m old enough that we don\u2019t need [Sean] Connery anymore \u2013 I\u2019m old enough to play my own father.\u2019 Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled for release in December next year.

Locals in Mottram even set up a Facebook campaign called 'Embarrassment of Mottram Christmas Tree!' and adorned it with tinsel and baubles themselves. Scroll down for video . Humbug!

It's absolutely rubbish. It's just a waste of time. Unless someone points it out you don't even notice it' One poster on the group suggested Mottram had the 'Worst Xmas tree in the UK / possibly the world'. Five miles away in Micklehurst, that village's tree still has the only decoration sanctioned by cash-strapped officials - a solitary string of fairy lights. Tameside Council, which has had to cut \u00a3142million from its budgets over five years, insisted the trees were a low-cost way of celebrating the festive season. The firs will not be ripped from the ground in January and will instead be left to grow, providing the villages with a larger tree each year. But that excuse did not prevent a backlash. Mottram hairdresser Louise Downing said: 'I thought the tree was a quite appalling. It's normally about 7ft - this one just looks like the top of last year's tree.

It's just going to bring people closer to complain.' In Micklehurst locals are hoping for some homespun decorations in their village, too. Ian Gauld, 57, said: 'At the moment the tree's pathetic and got to be the worst anywhere in the UK. 'It's absolutely rubbish. It's just a waste of time. Unless someone points it out you don't even notice it. It's hiding behind the lamp post.' Student Alex Bradley, 19, added: 'It's that small I thought somebody would nick it, but it's not even worth nicking. It's like a twig.' Not everyone was a fan of the community spirit in Mottram, however. Linda DeCarle, 68, said: 'They should have left it alone. They have made it worse. If you can't do it properly don't do it.' A spokesman for Labour-run Tameside Council said the trees were 'sustainable' and 'designed to provide a tree for many years to come'. Parish council minutes suggested the living trees cost around \u00a31,600 each - compared to \u00a32,000 each for temporary trees, a sum which would have to be paid again in full the next year. 'As is widely accepted local authorities up and down the country are facing huge cuts to their budgets so are continually under pressure to find more innovative ways of working,' the spokesman added. 'By providing living trees as a one-off cost the trees can be re-used year-on-year without the additional costs attached to erecting and taking down a new tree every Christmas. A Tameside Council spokesman said:\u00a0'By providing living trees as a one-off cost the trees can be re-used year-on-year without the additional costs attached to erecting and taking down a new tree every Christmas' Homespun: Locals decorated the Mottram tree with their own baubles - but one said it looked even worse . 'Because they are recently planted they are small, but will obviously grow into Christmas trees the whole community can enjoy. 'As an aside community-minded locals have already started dressing the tree in Mottram, which is bringing the community together at such a special time of year.' Micklehurst resident Irene Platt, 65, had little time for the excuse. 'The council should have planted that one and put another one up for this year,' she said. 'I haven't seen it lit but I doubt it will make much difference.' Tameside Council was unable to confirm whether it or parish councils paid for the trees. Do you know a worse Christmas tree?

Eccentric Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli might be deadly in front of goal but he proved that he's not quite so sharp with a pair of scissors and a roll of wrapping paper. In a hilarious two minute clip the apparently clueless Italian ace is shown how to wrap his Christmas gifts by teammate Carlos Tevez. But the exasperated Argentine becomes increasingly frustrated as Balotelli continually messes it up and blames being left handed for his failure. Scroll down for video . Taught a lesson: Balotelli blamed being left-handed for not being able to wrap his presents . Dab hand: Carlos Tevez wrapped his gifts with ease and attempted to show Mario Balotelli how to do it . Expert: Tevez shows his teammate how to neatly fold the edges of the wrapping paper . Concentrating: Balotelli watches Tevez closely but still doesn't appear to grasp the art of wrapping . Tutorial: The Argentinian asks Balotelli if he understands what he is telling him but the striker appears perplexed . The video, part of a daily Man City video advent calendar featuring some of the Premier League champion's galaxy of international stars taking getting involved in Christmas high jinks, has already been seen by more than 600,000 on YouTube. Balotelli, who will desperately need to work on his present wrapping skills after becoming a new father earlier this month, watches Tevez as he wraps his present with consummate ease. Speaking in Spanish, Balotelli asks the 28-year-old if he is going to wrap his presents as well. But despite a quick Tevez tutorial, Balotelli is unable to master the skill. Apparently giving up, he sighs: 'You know why, it's because I am left handed.' When asked what the difference is by Tevez, Balotelli replies: 'How can I do this if it's this way around?' Cheeky: The eccentric Man City star asks his teammate Carlos Tevez if he can wrap his gifts for him, but Tevez refuses . 'Mario, use your head': Tevez becomes increasingly frustrated as Balotelli fails to grasp what he is trying to teach him .

Frustrated forward Carlos snaps: 'Mario, use your head a bit! No wonder people say that you are daft.' Balotelli replies: 'I'm not daft. Look, it's difficult.' Clearly the former Inter Milan star was really struggling, in the following days advent offering Carlos Tevez's place at the wrapping table has been taken by England goalkeeper Joe Hart, but Balotelli is still struggling with his gifts and asking for help. It's likely that Balotelli's gift wasn't intended for his current employer - it was revealed over the weekend that the forward is takingthe club to a tribunal to dispute a \u00a334,000 fine for his poor discipline on the field. He has something of a reputation for being a little clumsy after famously setting his rented \u00a33million Manchester home alight in 2011 after letting off fireworks in the bathroom. Other amusing advent offerings from Man City's cameramen include French star Samir Nasri singing a Christmas carol in his native tongue, Aleksandar Kolorov giving a less than tuneful rendition of Jingle Bells and David Silva trying his first ever mince pie on camera.

Not because he could tell him how his Swindon team had ended Bristol City\u2019s unbeaten record. But because he could make it at all. Mark had spent the last international break at the hospital bedside in Tenerife where Terry, England\u2019s swashbuckling left back in the 1970 World Cup, was in intensive care following a life-or-death bowel cancer operation. It was a personal trauma he had done his best to keep to himself while handling the problems of helping the Football League\u2019s youngest team to recover from a 5-0 FA Cup hammering at Cheltenham. Mark Cooper saw his Swindon side beat Bristol City to end their unbeaten run in League One . Michael Smith scored the only goal of the game in the 78th minute at the County Ground . Cooper had been in Tenerife with his father . But on Saturday night the 45-year-old could enjoy calling to share the details of a successful day and how his side, with an average age of 21 and three quarters, had moved into League One\u2019s automatic promotion places. They had some help when City captain Wade Elliott got sent off after barely three minutes, but then passed the ball relentlessly to exploit their extra man before striker Michael Smith (right) finally picked his way through a packed defence to get the winner 12 minutes from time. \u2018I couldn\u2019t wait to speak to dad,\u2019 admitted Mark. \u2018He\u2019s back home and just about on a level now where he can focus and talk. He was in intensive care for 10 days and has had that many drugs. \u2018It was fortunate that when he was at his most critical it was the international break. We had three players called up then, so we had the weekend off and I managed to get out there for four days. \u2018The doctors said it was touch and go. I had to get there. He was in intensive care the whole time, it wasn\u2019t nice. \u2018Thankfully they say the operations have been successful and he\u2019s clear now and will keep recovering. He loves Bristol City and has such fond memories of his time there \u2014 as I do because that\u2019s where I started as a player \u2014 but for once he\u2019s probably happy they\u2019ve been beaten.\u2019 When the fixtures came out, this was the first his father had booked flights for from his Canary Island home, where he was based as Southampton\u2019s chief European scout. Mark\u2019s own playing career was far less stellar than his old man, who was a stalwart in Don Revie\u2019s all-conquering Leeds United teams of the 1960s \u2014 but after scrapping through non-League jobs at Tamworth, Kettering, Darlington and Telford he\u2019s fallen on his feet. Cooper's dad Terry was in intensive care after a make-or-break bowel cancer operation . Swindon is a club where chairman Lee Power, himself an ex-player, is building a strategy based on youth and a belief in passing football. The budget is a measly \u00a31.5million a year, a fraction of that spent by League One leaders City. But the faith in youth is both developing their own kids and making the club a favoured destination for Premier League sides to send their young talent on loan. Last season some of Tottenham\u2019s best youngsters, including Ryan Mason, progressed at the County Ground. This time Southampton\u2019s impressive England defender Jack Stephens, just 20, looked the pick of the potential. Terry Cooper (right) in action for England against Brazil's Jairzinho during the 1970 World Cup in Mexico . \u2018The chairman has been brilliant. He\u2019s an ex-player so he understands,\u2019 Cooper said. \u2018He put this club on a sound financial footing and insisted that we try and play real good football. He wants to do that so we can bring young players through.\u2019 Cooper knows it will take a miracle to keep his young side in the promotion hunt. It\u2019s a long season and a trip to Peterborough next week will be a more immediate challenge. But on Saturday night he could enjoy a small success. And more important, so could his dad. PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND . Bradford have taken time to adjust to League One since promotion through the play-offs in 2013 \u2014 but clicked to end Preston\u2019s unbeaten run at Deepdale which went back to December. They dominated after leading through Rory McArdle\u2019s first-half header \u2014 and even when Joe Garner scrambled an equaliser five minutes from time, it took just 60 seconds for Mark Yeates to curl in a 20-yard winner. Bradford ended Preston's unbeaten run at Deepdale which had stretched back to December with a 2-1 win . WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE... More like what my eye couldn\u2019t see \u2014 more than 117,000 people watched the 19 games in League One and Two on Saturday, yet the BBC don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth running The Football League Show on international weekends. Derek Asamoah had not played English football since walking out of Shrewsbury in 2007. That\u2019s until Carlisle gave him a shot \u2014 and the 33-year-old got his fourth goal in five in a 1-0 win over Accrington. Derek Asamoah celebrates after scoring the winner for Carlisle against Accrington . Roy Carroll earned top marks for commitment \u2014 catching a 5am flight from Bucharest to keep a clean sheet in Notts County\u2019s 1-0 win at Coventry, just 17 hours after playing for Northern Ireland.

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\n(CNN) -- A weekend of back-and-forth between two governors, the federal government and a nurse about mandatory quarantines left more questions than answers. At the heart of the debate: Would such quarantines on health workers who just came back from treating Ebola patients in West Africa help prevent the spread of the virus, or would they discourage medical aid workers from helping fight the global crisis? Here's what we know about the latest Ebola policies: . Who enacted tougher rules for health workers? New York, New Jersey and Illinois say anyone returning from having direct contact with Ebola patients in West Africa will have to be quarantined for 21 days. The 21-day period marks the maximum incubation period for Ebola. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn's office said the quarantine would be a \"home quarantine.\" \"This protective measure is too important to be voluntary,\" Quinn said. When New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced their new policies on Friday, they called for hospitalization or quarantine. But on Sunday night, after debate over the policies heated up, the governors said the quarantines could be carried out at home. Cuomo, Christie clarify policy on Ebola health worker quarantines . Would home quarantines even work? Depends on which side you ask. Neither Christie nor Cuomo explained how a home quarantine would work if family members were also in the home. It's also unclear how a home quarantine would or could be enforced if the quarantined person chose to leave the house. On the other hand, the governors say something had to be done; that asking returning medical workers to voluntarily quarantine themselves hasn't worked. Public health experts say there's plenty of scientific evidence indicating there's very little chance that a random people will get Ebola, unless they are in very close contact -- close enough to touch bodily fluids -- with someone who has it. Still, there's also a sense that authorities have to do something because of Americans' fears -- rational or not -- and the belief that the country is better off safe than sorry. As Mike Osterholm, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, says, \"You want to try to eliminate not just real risk, but perceived risk.\" What led up to the policies? Not long after she returned home from covering Ebola in Liberia, NBC medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman violated her voluntary quarantine in New Jersey to pick up takeout from a restaurant in October -- even after her colleague became infected. In New York, city workers scrambled to retrace the steps of Dr. Craig Spencer, who tested positive last week. He'd been on the subway and to a bowling alley, among other places. What are the concerns about such quarantines? The concerns are twofold: One, it could deter doctors and nurses from traveling to West Africa to help rid Ebola; and two, it could greatly impede the livelihoods of health care workers. \"If I lose three weeks on my return and don't get to do the work I'm supposed to do ... means this wouldn't be workable for me,\" said Dr. John Carlson, a pediatric immunologist at Tulane University. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expressed a similar view earlier this month, arguing that stringent travel restrictions might create more problems than they solve. \"It makes it hard to get health workers in, because they can't get out,\" Dr. Tom Frieden said. \"If we make it harder to respond to the outbreak in West Africa, it will spread not only in those three countries (in West Africa hit hardest by Ebola), but to other parts of Africa and ultimately increase the risk here\" in the United States. Who would pay for the time off? Cuomo added that if employers don't pay quarantined workers for the time they are absent while under quarantine, \"the government will.\" How has this affected health care workers? The same day the governors announced their tougher policies Friday, nurse Kaci Hickox arrived at Newark Liberty Airport after spending a month helping treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. She didn't have any symptoms and tested negative for Ebola. Nonetheless, the nurse from Kent, Maine, was holed up inside a quarantine tent at University Hospital in Newark over the weekend. She was released from the hospital Monday, according to her attorney, and will return to Maine. \"This is an extreme that is really unacceptable, and I feel like my basic human rights have been violated,\" Hickox told CNN's Candy Crowley on \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. She slammed Christie for describing her as \"obviously ill.\" \"First of all, I don't think he's a doctor. Secondly, he's never laid eyes on me. And thirdly, I've been asymptomatic since I've been here,\" Hickox said. Is Hickox's quarantine unconstitutional? Attorney Stephen Hyman said there's a \"legal basis\" to challenge the quarantine policies in New Jersey and in New York, but the nurse isn't sure she wants to do so. Christie said he was glad that Hickox had been released and defended his actions. \"The reason she was put in the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic. If you live in New Jersey, you're quarantined in your home. \"That's always been the policy. If you live outside the state, and you're symptomatic, we're not letting you go onto public transportation. It makes no common sense. The minute she was no longer symptomatic, she was released,\" the governor said. Hickox said she has nothing to recover from. Her temperature is normal, and she feels fine. Who else might amp up Ebola rules? Florida is starting mandatory monitoring for all travelers returning from West Africa, and Virginia is following suit. \"Virginia will implement an active monitoring program on Monday for all returning passengers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with a special emphasis on returning health care workers,\" said Virginia governor spokesman Brian Coy. Cuomo says he knows some people probably think he's overreacting. \"We're staying one step ahead,\" the governor said. \"Some people will say we are being too cautious. I'll take that criticism because that's better than the alternative.\" Isn't there a middle ground? There is. One possibility is to have those travelers go through more than just temperature checks. Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of Columbia University's National Center for Disaster Preparedness, says one such measure could be checking daily for decreases in white blood cell counts or platelets -- which could be, but aren't necessarily, a sign of an Ebola infection. And Osterholm thinks there should be stricter controls on what a person who arrives from West Africa does in his or her first three weeks in the United States. For instance, he thinks such a person shouldn't take public transportation or go to crowded places like bowling alleys -- both of which officials say Spencer did before he was symptomatic. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Ray Sanchez, Sara Fischer, Joe Sutton and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.",

Lancaster will take his troops to the Millennium Stadium in two weeks' time to begin the pursuit of a first Six Nations crown since he took over in 2012. Focus will then turn to a World Cup on home soil in the autumn where England must finish in the top two of a group featuring both Australia and Wales to make the quarter finals. England coach Stuart Lancaster has been given full support by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie . Ritchie has praised the England coach for the 'bigger role' he plays beyond just training the team . Ritchie admits the pressure will be on Lancaster to get to the latter stages of the tournament but he is confident the right man is in charge to lead the team forward. 'The number one objective is coaching the team - absolutely his focus in terms of 2015,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'But again I think he's got that bigger role. He's also got a role about engagement with the public, engagement with the game as a whole. 'You've heard me talk about inter-connection.

The awarding of a six-year contract the year before a World Cup raised a few eyebrows but Ritchie insists he has even more faith in Lancaster now than he did the day the coach was appointed. 'We had a great advisory panel. I was sat there at the first meeting with Ian McGeechan, Conor O' Shea, Richard Hill and Rob Andrew,' he said.

Not only does Stuart have that understanding and appreciation, but it's palpably clear that this is a guy who has values. 'We could all say, 'Yes, but it's all about winning'.

The Celebrity Cruises ship Mercury departed Charleston, South Carolina, February 15 and headed for the eastern Caribbean, according to a Celebrity Cruises statement. On the way, 419 of the 1,838 passengers fell ill, along with 27 of the 849 crew members, the cruise line said. The number of affected passengers increased from the 353 reported the day before. Their symptoms included upset stomach, vomiting and diarrhea, Celebrity Cruises spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said. Guests who were in isolation while ill will receive compensation, she said. The sickened passengers and crew have been administered over-the-counter medicine and are responding well, Celebrity Cruises said. But it is still unclear how they became sick, Martinez said. Medical samples will be sent to a lab for testing Tuesday, she added. The ship's medical facility first started treating guests Sunday, Martinez said, and by Monday, hundreds of others were sick, too, Celebrity Cruises reported. A doctor and two nurses joined the cruise medical staff Monday to help with the overload of patients when the ship stopped in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, according to the statement. The ship does not return to Charleston until Friday and will be at sea until then, Martinez said. To control the outbreak, the crew has stepped up cleaning of the ship, which is advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurs. Norovirus commonly causes viral gastrointestinal illness outbreaks on cruise ships, the CDC says. It can spread from contact with contaminated food or drink, by touching objects infected by people who are already sickened, or through close contact with people who are infected, according to the CDC. So far this year, three gastrointestinal illness outbreaks have occurred on cruise ships that docked at a U.S. port, according to the CDC. Norovirus was the cause of two outbreaks on the Mercury in 2009, the CDC reported. The outbreaks reported and investigated by the CDC infected at least 3 percent of the people onboard the cruises carrying at least 100 passengers for anytime between three days to three weeks.",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\nThe mysteries surrounding the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and the true identities of some of its passengers, are as deep as the southeast Asian waters where multinational search teams are searching for the jet. Navies from two of Malaysia's neighbors were pursuing new leads as Sunday turned into Monday in the region. Vietnam's navy has spotted a floating object about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Vietnam's Tho Chu Island, which is off the country's southwest coast in the Gulf of Thailand, Vietnam National Search and Rescue Committee spokesman Hung Nguyen told CNN. The object was spotted by a Vietnamese navy rescue aircraft at about 7:30 a.m. ET Sunday (6:30 p.m. local time). Because of the dark, the navy aircraft could not get close enough to identify the floating object and was recalled to base. Three search and rescue boats have since been deployed to that location. Meanwhile, Thailand's navy is shifting its focus in the search away from the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, Thai Navy Rear Adm. Karn Dee-ubon told CNN on Sunday. The shift came at the request of the Malaysians, who are looking into possibilities the plane turned around and could have gone down in the Andaman Sea, near Thailand's border, Karn said. The Andaman Sea lies to the west of a narrow strip of Thailand that ends in the Malaysian Peninsula, while the Gulf of Thailand lies to the east of that Thai isthmus. One promising lead has turned out to be a dead end. A \"strange object\" spotted by a Singaporean search plane late Sunday afternoon is not debris from the missing jetliner, a U.S. official familiar with the issue told CNN on Sunday. A U.S. reconnaissance plane \"thought it saw something like debris, but it was a false alarm,\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. By the end of the day Sunday, more than 40 planes and more than two dozen ships from several countries were involved in the search. Two reconnaissance aircraft from Australia and one plane and five sea vessels from Indonesia were the latest additions, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the director general of civil aviation in Malaysia, told reporters Sunday. In addition, the Chinese navy dispatched a frigate and an amphibious landing ship, according to an online post by China's navy. Those reinforcements join the rescue teams already scouring the South China Sea, near the Gulf of Thailand, for any sign of where the flight, operated by Malaysia's flagship airline, might have gone down, Malaysian authorities said. The area in focus for most of the search, about 90 miles south of Tho Chu Island, is where a Vietnamese plane reportedly spotted oil slicks that stretched between 6 and 9 miles. \"I can confirm that there was an oil slick, no debris. But what we are doing now, I was told that the Vietnamese aircrafts are on the site right now to verify what actually is it on the surface of those waters,\" said acting Malaysian Transportation Minister Hishammuddin bin Tun Hussein. Big questions far outweigh the few fragments of information that have emerged about the plane's disappearance: . What happened to the plane? Why was no distress signal issued? Who exactly was aboard? The flight may have changed course and turned back toward Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian military officials said at a news conference Sunday. But the pilot appears to have given no signal to authorities that he was turning around, the officials said, attributing the change of course to indications from radar data. As the search continues, the agonizing wait goes on for relatives of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board the plane. Video from Reuters showed Malaysia Airlines personnel in Beijing, where Flight 370 was headed, helping family members apply for expedited passports so they could fly to Kuala Lumpur early this week. Among the passengers, 154 people were from China or Taiwan; 38 Malaysians, five Indian nationals and three U.S. citizens. Five of the passengers were younger than 5 years old. Malaysia Airlines said Monday that initial financial assistance has been given out to all passengers' families \"over and above their basic needs.\" Each family has also been assigned at least one caregiver. \"Malaysia Airlines' primary focus at this point in time is to care for the families. This means providing them with timely information, travel facilities, accommodation, meals, medical and emotional support,\" the airline said in a statement. Stolen passports . Interpol tweeted Sunday that it is \"examining additional suspect #passports in connection\" with the missing flight. Earlier, the international law enforcement agency said at least two passports -- one Austrian and one Italian -- recorded in its stolen and lost travel documents database were used by passengers onboard the flight. The passports were added to the database after being stolen in separate incidents over the past two years, Interpol said. Italy and Austria have said that none of their citizens were onboard the plane. \"No checks of the stolen Austrian and Italian passports were made by any country between the time they were entered into INTERPOL's database and the departure of flight MH 370. At this time, INTERPOL is therefore unable to determine on how many other occasions these passports were used to board flights or cross borders,\" the agency said in a Sunday statement. It added that passengers were able to board planes more than a billion times last year without having their passports screened by Interpol's databases. The Italian man whose passport was allegedly used, Luigi Maraldi, contacted the Italian consulate in Phuket, Thailand, on Saturday, after receiving a call from his parents, Italian Consul Franco Cavaliere told CNN on Sunday. Maraldi told Reuters he was inundated with phone calls, texts and social media inquiries asking if he was alive and well. He soon discovered that he was the subject of stories about the missing plane. Maraldi is staying on Phuket Island as a tourist, and his passport disappeared in July 2013, Cavaliere said. Maraldi told Reuters he got a new passport after his old one was stolen. \"Whilst it is too soon to speculate about any connection between these stolen passports and the missing plane, it is clearly of great concern that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in INTERPOL's databases,\" said Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble in a statement. The two passengers who used the passports in question appear to have bought their tickets together. The tickets were bought from China Southern Airlines at identical prices, paid in Thailand's baht currency, according to China's official e-ticket verification system Travelsky. The ticket numbers are contiguous, which indicates the tickets were issued together. The two tickets booked with China Southern Airlines both start in Kuala Lumpur, fly to Beijing, and then onward to Amsterdam. The Italian passport's ticket continues to Copenhagen, the Austrian's to Frankfurt. Authorities say they are investigating the identities of some of those onboard who appear to have issues with their passports. \"I've seen these reports about the passports. We're looking into that, but we don't have anything to confirm at this point,\" U.S. deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. \"The reports certainly raise questions and concerns, and that's exactly why we're looking into them. But right now, it would be premature to speculate,\" he said. Plane was 'at safest point' in flight . Terrorism concerns . A fuller picture of what happened may not become available until searchers find the plane and its flight data recorder. \"We have not been able to locate anything, see anything,\" Rahman told reporters Sunday. The passport mystery raised concerns about the possibility of terrorism, but officials cautioned that it was still too early to arrive at any conclusions. Malaysian authorities have been in contact with counterterrorism organizations about possible passport issues, acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Sunday. He didn't specify how many potential passport issues there were, saying authorities are looking at the whole passenger manifest. Additionally, no inquiry was made by Malaysia Airlines to determine if any passengers on the flight were traveling on stolen passports, he said. Many airlines do not check the database, he said. Five passengers ended up not boarding the aircraft. Their bags were removed and were not onboard the jet when it disappeared, Hussein said. A U.S. intelligence official said that no link to terrorism had been discovered so far, but that authorities were still investigating. Another possible explanation for the use of the stolen passports is illegal immigration. There are previous cases of illegal immigrants using fake passports to try to enter Western countries. And Southeast Asia is known to be a booming market for stolen passports. Disappearing during cruise . There is a precedent for a modern jetliner to fall from the sky while \"in the cruise\" and lie hidden for months, according to CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. On June 1, 2009, Air France Flight 447 was en route from Rio De Janeiro to Paris when communications ended suddenly from the Airbus A330, another state-of-the-art aircraft. It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of flight 447's wreckage and the majority of the 228 bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean. It took even longer to find the cause of the disaster. In May 2011, the aircraft's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles. It was not until July 2012 that investigators published their report, which blamed the crash on a series of errors by the pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems. The missing Malaysia Airlines plane had suffered damage in the past, airline CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said Sunday. The aircraft had a clipped wing tip, but Boeing repaired it, and the jet was safe to fly, Yahya said. The National Transportation Safety Board announced late Saturday that a team of its investigators was en route to Asia to help with the investigation, the agency said. If all those on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 are found to have died, it will rank as the deadliest airline disaster since November 12, 2001, when American Airlines Flight 587 crashed into a New York neighborhood, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground. The deadliest commercial air crash ever involving a single plane occurred almost 30 years ago on August 12, 1985, in the mountains of central Japan. A total of 520 people were killed when Japan Airlines Flight 123 -- a Boeing 747 -- crashed not long after takeoff from Tokyo. Four people survived.",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a middle school student:\n\n(CNN) -- Most artists have to wait years -- or perhaps an eternity -- to earn serious money from their work. Aidan Reed, on the other hand, earned more than $83,000 in a few weeks, and he's only 5. Aidan's art is of monsters -- green ones, black ones, scary ones, silly ones. The people who buy his drawings aren't necessarily art lovers or monster lovers. They just want to help Aidan, whose leukemia was diagnosed three months ago, and whose parents nearly had to sell their house because of the financial difficulties of dealing with cancer. When Aidan's family started selling his drawings online in early October, his parents thought they'd sell a few each week. They never imagined it could more than make up for the income they were losing because Aidan's father, Wiley Reed, had to take unpaid time off  to be with Aidan during treatments. \"We were in the hospital with Aidan, and my husband and I were talking about selling the house, which I didn't want to do. I was really upset,\" said his mother, Katie Reed. \"While we were there, we found out we'd sold over 2,000 drawings. I just fell down crying. It was so awesome. I knew we'd finally be OK.\" \"He's a great artist, but I never thought he'd be famous at 5,\" adds Reed, who lives in Clearwater, Kansas, and gave birth to Aidan's little brother, Amry, just 12 days after Aidan's cancer diagnosis. An aunt's love . The idea for selling Aidan's artwork came from his father's sister, Mandi Ostein, who lives in Peoria, Illinois, and was trying to think of a way to help from afar. She had to look no further than her newborn son's nursery for answers. A few months before he got sick, Aidan had sent her some of his drawings to decorate his cousin's room. \"I'd sold items I've made on etsy.com -- purses, bags, clothes -- and I thought we could sell Aidan's drawings there, too,\" she says. Ostein opened up a shop,Aidan's Monsters, on the popular website. \"When I first mentioned it to my brother, he thought it was crazy,\" she adds. \"But I thought we could sell 60 by Thanksgiving.\" Instead, she sold nearly 7,000 by Thanksgiving for $12 a piece. She says sales really took off when a friend of hers convinced a website called regretsy.com, which usually pokes fun of the products on etsy.com, to promote sales of Aidan's drawings. Now selling Aidan's art has become a full-time job, in addition to taking care of her baby. \"I print, package, ship and answer e-mails from home,\" she says. \"Upstairs is the printing department, downstairs is the shipping department, and wherever I am is the PR department.\" Ostein says she knows why Aidan's drawings are selling so phenomenally well. \"People really want to help,\" Ostein says. \"They say Aidan's story really touches them.\" Aidan's story . Aidan was a healthy 5-year-old until late this past summer when he started having fevers that wouldn't go away, no matter how many medicines his pediatrician prescribed. Then on the weekend of September 10, he developed a terrible cough, and his parents noticed bruises on his body. \"Usually Aidan tells us if he's hurt himself or run into something, but he couldn't explain these bruises at all,\" Reed says. The Reeds took Aidan to the pediatrician's office that Monday, and blood tests confirmed the worst: Aidan had leukemia. He started treatment the next day at Wesley Medical Center in Wichita, Kansas, receiving several rounds of chemotherapy. Wiley Reed works for Cessna training factory workers, and his insurance is good. While the family is responsible for a $250 co-payment when Aidan goes to the hospital, most of the rest of his care is covered. What set them back financially is that Wiley has had to take unpaid time off work. His wife stays at home with Aidan and his baby brother, so the family had to go without any income. \"We were buying cheaper groceries and cutting way back on clothes, and we're not big shoppers to begin with,\" Katie Reed says. \"The money from the drawings really relieved us. When insurance isn't enough . Reed says she never imagined how expensive an illness could be even when you do have good insurance. \"If I were to see this story, I would think to myself, 'These people have insurance. What are they talking about?' \" Reed says. In addition to her husband's lost wages, the family has had other expenses, such as buying food at the hospital instead of cooking at home. The Reeds' situation isn't unusual, says Jeanie Barnett, director of communications for CancerCare, an organization that helps people affected by cancer. \"Cancer is an incredibly expensive disease,\" Barnett says. \"And no one budgets to have cancer.\" There are lost wages, which the Reeds faced, as well as transportation costs to and from the hospital. Plus, even good insurance doesn't cover all the costs. \"You can get socked at the pharmacy for $900 a month, or even $3,000 a month, and that's with insurance,\" Barnett says. Families have become clever about how to raise money, she adds. For example, parents of one child with cancer held a \"pie-a-thon,\" cooking pies for 48 hours straight and selling them. For help facing the financial burdens of cancer, contact CancerCare or the Cancer Financial Assistance Coalition. And a previous Empowered Patient column also offered advice:After cancer diagnosis, what comes next? Barnett urges patients and their families who are having fundraisers to beware of the taxman: If you raise a lot of money, you could get pushed into a higher income bracket and face higher taxes. To learn more about smart fundraising, see page 3 of this guide from the National Marrow Donor Program. Aidan's future . The Reeds are right now trying to figure out now how much of their income from the drawings is taxable. Some of it they've used to pay their mortgage and other expenses, but some has also been used for art supplies for Aidan. Ostein says sales are still going strong even though she's told customers that for the time being the family is fine. Money from future sales will be put away for later. Wiley Reed is back at work but takes unpaid time off when Aidan has a doctor's appointment. \"He gets a spinal tap every three weeks, and those are not good to go through,\" Katie Reed says. \"I can't emotionally handle it. I always have to leave the room, so Wiley's the one who stays strong for him and holds his hand.\" She says the response to Aidan's drawings has helped her emotionally, not just financially. \"I love reading the happy stories people leave on Aidan's blog about how they've been through this, and it does get better,\" she says. \"It's really helped me stay positive through all this because I was really depressed seeing my child have to go through all this not knowing whether he'd make it or not.\" As for Aidan, he keeps drawing, sometimes for hours a day, even when he's in the hospital. He recently started to draw jesters (\"he loves the hats and the bells,\" his mother says), and he's asked Santa for a four-faced clown mask he saw online for Christmas. Still, monsters are his main theme. \"I don't think he realizes it, but monsters have become iconic for him,\" she says. \"I think he likes them because he's fighting a monster inside himself.\"",

Leanne Hecht Bearden, 33, was last seen January 17 when she told her in-laws in Garden Ridge near San Antonio that she was going for a walk. She has not been heard from since. The woman and her husband, Joshua Bearden, were staying with his parents after returning from their travels earlier this month. Missing: Leanne Hecht Bearden went for a walk in Texas and never returned . In a statement released on a Facebook page dedicated to Bearden's search, her relatives suggested that the 33-year-old woman may have left on her on accord because she was struggling to adjust to life in the U.S. \u2018The pressure of transitioning from her two year trip back into what we consider \"normal\" life seems to have left her very anxious and stressed,\u2019 the statement read. \u2018As a result of this investigation there is evidence that Leanne may have voluntarily left the area, and we understand this is a strong possibility.\u2019 The local police, sheriff's deputies, the Texas Rangers, a group of friends and volunteers have spent the past two weeks scouring Garden Ridge and its vicinity in search of Bearden, but to no avail, the station KENS5 reported. The theory that the 33-year-old globetrotter took off voluntarily has been supported by evidence found on her computers by private investigator Charlie Parker. Cracked under pressure? Bearden's family said the women may have left on her on because she could not handle the stress of adjusting to a normal life in the United States after her travels . Adventure: The couple pose on a Goa beach during their two-year round the world trip . Garden Ridge police reached a similar conclusion, adding that they have found nothing to suggest that Bearden was the victim of a foul play. Her husband, Josh Bearden, said that while his wife is fit and athletic, she is small in stature. The fear is that the woman may have been bitten by a snake or got injured. \u2018Her mental and physical status is uncertain. We fear for her greatly,\u2019 her relatives said. \u2018If Leanne has indeed fled the area, she is extremely vulnerable. She left with only a few assets and is traveling very light.\u2019 On Wednesday, the private investigator hired by the family released photos of two diamond rings worn by Mrs Bearden in hopes that someone might recognize them, Houston Chronicle reported. \u2018If she's running, she might try to pawn them,\u2019 Parker said. \u2018And if someone else has them, they might try to pawn them.\u2019 Earlier this week, Mr Bearden offered a message of hope for his missing wife. Heartbroken: Joshua Bearden made an emotional plea to try to find his wife. Her body was found Thursday . \u2018Baby, don\u2019t be scared. We\u2019re looking . for you. And we\u2019re never ever going to stop looking for you,\u2019 Joshua . Bearden told Leanne through a TV camera lens. Bearden . was speaking out in hopes continued public interest in his wife\u2019s . strange disappearance would help his cause, since police have now called . off the official search. \u2018As far as any sort of search in the area, we\u2019re on our own on that,\u2019 he . said on Fox & Friends, one of several interviews he\u2019s now done. \u2018If . you see Leanne, let somebody know.

'The second I lose my hope, Leanne is gone,' he told KSAT. 'My biggest fear is that I lose hope.' Travels: The couple had just returned to the U.S. after their journey around the world . Police and family members are . desperately searching for the 33-year-old woman recently returned from a . two-year, around-the-world trip who disappeared during a visit to . relatives in Texas. Leanne . Hecht Bearden and her husband Joshua traveled the world . for 22 months without a mishap but after returning to the U.S. Leanne . Bearden has gone missing. The . couple was staying with Joshua Bearden's parents near San Antonio last . week after returning from their trip abroad when she went out for a walk . and never returned. Bearden, a marketing graduate, left the house in Garden Ridge on January 17 wearing jeans and hiking boots and carrying about $60 in cash and some credit cards. She also had a red backpack with her that reportedly contained several energy bars. 'We're very concerned,' Bearden's brother Michael Hecht told WSBTV. 'She left of her own free will to go for a walk and that's all we know. We're wondering what's happened. Maybe she went for a hike, saw a nice place somewhere she could hike and maybe is hurt, or has fallen over. We don't know.' The couple had intended to stay briefly in Texas before flying to their home in Denver to begin searching for work. According to CNN, the couple has been married for four years. Grief: Leanne's family are devastated by their loss and thanked the many people involved in trying to find the 33-year-old . 'Her husband is devastated right now and is extremely worried. We're just trying to help out the Police Department as much as we can canvassing the area, even going father out than we think she may be. But we have absolutely no idea where she is,' Hecht told WBSTV. According to My San Antonio, Bearden was planning to return to the home within an hour in order to take a phone call about a job in Denver. She was reported missing by her husband after she had been gone about four hours. At about that time, Bearden's parents returned home from an out-of-town trip. Search: Facebook pages and leaflets were set up to try to find Leanne . 'We could draw up scenarios that range from the sublime to the ridiculous,' Will Bearden told My San Antonio.

Jubilant scenes are expected in Belgium tomorrow as the nation prepares to welcome a new monarch. But the day King Albert II will officially hand the throne to his son Crown Prince Phillippe comes as the soon-to-be ex-monarch, 79, is embroiled in a paternity scandal that has resurfaced after more than a decade. Artist Delphine Bo\u00ebl, 45, insists she is the daughter of King Albert, and has now launched legal proceedings in a bid to prove she is a member of the Belgian royal family through DNA tests. Paternity claims: Artist Delphine Bo\u00ebl, left, claims to be the daughter of King Albert II of Belgium, right . Tight-lipped: King Albert was seen with his wife Queen Paola on a visit to Liege yesterday, as he gets set to yield the country's throne to his son . The palace has remained tight-lipped on Ms Bo\u00ebl's claims, but her efforts to use the courts to force the king to provide a DNA sample has dominated the headlines in Belgian newspapers and magazines. 'This is a private affair, and we have no comment whatsoever,' spokesman Bruno Neve told the\u00a0International Herald Tribune. It was first revealed that Albert fathered an illegitimate child in a book published in 1999, and middle-aged artist Ms Bo\u00ebl is adamant that she is the child in question. Sad farewell: Queen Paola appeared to be overcome with emotion at one point during their visit to the French community in Liege . She has given a series of interviews with the media in both Belgium and France, insisting she is driven by the desire for vindication rather than any claim on the king's fortune. 'I am deeply saddened, but I believe blood can work wonders,' she was quoted as saying last month. 'I don't believe that my legal action will end all discrimination against me or my family, or mend my personal relationship with my father, but with DNA proof there will be undeniable certainty about my identity,' she said in a statement as she launched legal proceedings. To date two court hearings have taken place - both behind closed doors. 'No comment': King Albert II, third from left, is preparing to hand the throne to his son Crown Prince Philippe, seen left in a family photograph in Brussels . Ms Bo\u00ebl's mother, Sybile de Selys Longchamps, has backed her daughter's efforts to have her alleged royal lineage recognised, and says she had an affair with the king lasting 18 years. Albert's marriage to Queen Paola is understood to have been turbulent at times, with the couple spending long spells living apart over the years and coming close to divorce in the past. The royal family will no doubt be hoping Ms Bo\u00ebl's statements both in and out of the Brussels courtroom - among the artist's creations is a sculpture comprising the words 'love' and 'child' separated by a heart topped with a crown - will not overshadow tomorrow's historic occasion. Belgium's political and social elite will gather to see the monarch sign a declaration of abdication and his son Prince Phillippe, 53, will be sworn in as Belgium's new king.",

While the original charge of planning an act of terror against Omarjan Azari, 22, still stands, prosecutors on Friday conceded the alleged act was not a beheading and was not planned for Martin Place, the scene of this week's siege. Azari appeared by video link from Silverwater prison after being transported from the Supermax jail in Goulburn, ahead of a planned bail application. During Friday's hearing he was charged with three fresh counts - two of knowingly making funds available to a terrorist organisation and one of attempting to make funds available to a terrorist organisation. Scroll down for video . Deep inside Supermax: Ormarjan Azari (pictured on his way to prison following his arrest on at his parents' house on September 18) is being held in the High Risk Management Correctional Centre - Australia's most secure jail - under its strictest inmate classification . Azari has been charged along with a 25-year-old man who was arrested in Beecroft in Sydney and taken into custody earlier this week. Azari is charged along with Ali Al-Talebi with transferring money to ISIS via two Western Sydney money transfer businesses. Police allege that on August 6, Azari and other males went to a Travelex store in Parramatta Westfield Shopping Centre and deposited $3000, which was to go via Pakistan to Australian ISIS recruiter Mohammad Ali Baryalei in Syria. Prosecution screw up: Prominent Sydney barrister, Winston Terracini SC, (pictured) told a Sydney court last month that a phone call at the centre of the case against accused terrorist, Omarjan Azari, had a 'glaring error' in its translation from Arabic to English. He also said authorities had conspired to deny Azari any prison visits by his family . Azari allegedly waited outside the Travelex as the other males deposited the money. The following day, August 7, Azari allegedly transferred $3000, in the company of other males, to Syria via Pakistan at the Western Union money transfer shop in Auburn in Western Sydney. The money was going to Baryalei via a man in Peshawar called Zia Abdulhaq, who has since been killed. Then on August 8, Azari and Al-Taledi attempted to transfer $9211 to Syria at the Bisotel Rieh Travel Agency, which is owned by the sister of Australian Syrian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf. The agency, which is operated by Damour Sharrouf and her husband, Ahmed Alwash, has since been shut down by federal agencies. Azari was arrest in a dawn raid during a large counter-terrorism operation (pictured) by hundreds of police across Sydney . Azari's lawyer, Steve Boland, said  widespread media coverage claiming Azari had planned a beheading and chosen Martin Place for the act was nonsense and that it would be almost impossible for Azari to get a fair trial given the 'extraordinary circumstances and the public atmosphere at the moment'. 'It has emerged that the Crown has absolutely no evidence of such a thing,'\u00a0Mr Boland said about allegations Azar was planning to publicly behead a member of the public in Martin Place, video the killing and then drape the victims body with a ISIS flag. Commonwealth prosecutor Michael Allnutt said that in the charges against Azari, there had never been any mention of an execution in Martin Place. According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call \u00a0on September 16 from former Sydney nightclub bouncer, Mohammad Ali Baryalei (pictured) in Syria to a man outside Omarjan Azari's house in Guildford in western Sydney and a plot to behead a person and drape them in the ISIS flag was discussed . Azari's bail application will now go ahead on February 24 on the three new charges of financing terrorist activity in Syria. Last month, lawyers for Azari claimed there was a a 'glaring error' in the federal prosecution case against him, saying the official translation of a phone call at the centre of the police evidence against the 22-year-old apprentice mechanic. Prominent Sydney barrister Winston Terracini SC also said Azari - who is being held in Australia's toughest jail, Supermax in Goulburn - was being kept apart from his family who are not allowed to visit. Leading Sydney silk: Winston Terracini SC (right) and solicitor Ben Archbold (left) are pictured leaving Central Local Court in November following their appearance before Magistrate Greg Grogin on behalf of Omarjan Azari, the 22-year-old apprentice motor mechanic who police allege was planning to behead a member of the public . Azarai, a former soccer fanatic and Parramatta High School student who grew up in Sydney's western suburbs, was arrested on September 18 at his parents' home in Guildford in what was one of dozens of raids in a counter-terrorism operation by hundreds of police on homes in Sydney and Brisbane. According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days before the raids between Azari and former Sydney nightclub bouncer, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East. Mr Terracini told Central Local Court magistrate Greg Grogin in November that he had already had an Arabic speaker listen to the phone call in which prosecutors allege Azari made the threat to behead a person in Sydney's Martin Place. Prominent Sydney barrister Winston Terracini also said Azari - who is being held in Australia's toughest jail, Supermax in Goulburn - has been kept apart from his family who are not allowed to visit . 'There is at least one glaring error which goes to the crux of whether this young man is involved in a terrorist act,' Mr Terracini said of the prosecution's translation of the phone call. Mr Terracini said despite the Commonwealth DPP serving many documents in its brief of evidence against Azari, 'only one piece of evidence is relevant'. 'It seems to be the fact there is only one telephone call ... and there are inaccuracies in the translation.' Around 12 homes were searched on September 18 in Sydney\u2019s northwest suburbs by NSW Police and Australian Federal Police (AFP). Police confiscated a sword (above, left) and materials from the cars of suspects (above, right) during the September 18 raids across NSW and Queensland in the nation's biggest counter terrorism offensive . Around 12 homes, including the house (pictured) where Omarjan Azari had been living with his parents, brothers and sister, were searched in Sydney\u2019s northwest suburbs by NSW  and Australian Federal Police . Azari has been in custody in in the Supermax High Risk Management correctional centre for three months since the raids. Mr Terracini said Azari had been prevented from seeing his family by Corrective Services and prosecutors conspiring in a 'secret' agreement to ban 'visitors of any kind ... family, his parents who have no criminal convictions, his sister who has no conviction'. Commonwealth prosecutor Karen Leavy told the court her office had 'no influence' over inmate classification. Mr Terracini said Azari's defence team was not interested in the 180 or more documents gathered by the Commonwealth DPP and that the telephone allegedly used in the call from which the terrorism charge arose did not belong to the accused. 'We are interested in the phone used allegedly by this man which the prosecution knows was not his,' Mr Terracini said. Azari is accused of conspiring with Baryalei 'and others' in planning a terrorist act between 12.01am on March 8 this year and 4.30am on September 18, the time and date of his arrest. Following Omarjan Azari's arrest, heavily armed police (pictured) escorted him from Central Local Court down to the Goulburn Supermax Jail where he has been held under strict conditions . Azari was arrested the day after his parents left Australia to fly to Saudi Arabia for the religious holiday, the Hajj. The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack, which the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP)said was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'. CDPP prosecutor Michael Allnutt told Central Local Court during Omarjan Azari's first court appearance on the day he was arrested that he had had made a threat during a phone call a few days prior to the raid which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute'. Azari had displayed 'an unusual level of fanaticism' in the call, which was intercepted by police, Mr Allnutt said. Court documents suggest the plotting for a public beheading between Omarjan Azarai, Baryalei 'and others' began on May 8, and prosecutors say Azari knew he was under police surveillance . Court documents suggest their plotting began on May 8, and the court heard Azari knew he was under police surveillance. Azari is being held in Supermax under NSW prisons highest security classification, which means he would not be allowed to hold telephone conversations in any language but English.

He has long been celebrated for highlighting the beauty of the industrial North. But Lancashire artist LS Lowry may not have been quite as fond of his roots as previously thought, according to newly-discovered letters. The artist, famous for his 'matchstick men' paintings, privately described his hometown of Manchester as 'a place of the dead', it has emerged. Many of Lowry's drawings and paintings depict Salford. He painted scenes of life in the industrial districts of Northern England . The comment was made in a confidential letter to a friend after Lowry had visited the city, the subject of many of his most famous works. The less than flattering assessment is ironic given the backlash Lowry received from the art world for being 'too Northern'. He is said to have resented the London-centric galleries of his day who adopted a snobbish attitude towards his background. He defiantly produced scores of landscapes depicting northern cities and the people that lived there, often seeking to show the working class way of life. LS Lowry, artist in 1966: New letters suggest that the famous Northern son might not have been quite as proud of his roots as previously thought . More recently, he has been held up as a champion of the North by Tate Modern and other arts organisations. But experts said that his relationship with Manchester and its surrounding towns was much more complex than may people think. Dr Philip Best said: 'Lowry has now become a symbol for people who are keen to promote a new Northern identity. He is a symbol of the vibrancy and cultural wealth of Manchester. 'But that's not quite how he would have seen it in his lifetime. 'When one looks at his paintings, the people are all dressed in the same drab clothing. They're walking around in a daze against an industrial backdrop. 'He is portrayed as a person celebrating the vibrancy of the working class north which is an interesting thing if he described it as a place of the dead. An oil on canvas work by 20th Century British artist Laurence Stephen Lowry . 'When people pass away they often end up being used to promote which ever agenda people seek to push.' The letter is going on sale for the first time after a close friend of the artist put it up for auction. It was written to his art critic friend Mervin Levy on October 19, 1962, from his then home in Mottram-in Longdendale. The note read: 'After about 10 days in London, Manchester seems like a place of the dead - quite deserted in comparison.' Lowry's note to Levy referred to an enclosed a letter also written by the painter to Levy's editor at Studio magazine in which the artist wrote that his friend had 'revitalised' the publication. Lowry's Lancashire Fair Good Friday 1946 . It seems the artist posted both signed letters from Glossop to London in the same envelope. The pair of letters are part of a single lot valued at between \u00a3700 and \u00a31,000 by the auctioneers, Fraser's, as part of a wider sale of other non-Lowry artefacts, Autographs, Historical Documents & Memoribilia this Thursday. The current owner obtained the letters from Mr Levy alongside other LS Lowry keepsakes for his private collection.LS Lowery, who died in 1976, was frequently mocked by the London-centric art world because he was a self-taught 'Sunday painter'. The rent collector's roots were firmly based in and around Manchester, having been raised in Salford and attending college in Salford and Manchester before finally earning recognition from the London-based art elite. Earlier this year the capital doffed a belated flat cap to honour Lowry with the first major exhibition to honour the world-renowned artist in 37 years. Tate Britain's Lowry and the Painting of Modern Life exhibition, which came to a close in October, aimed to re-examine the painter 'for a new and extended audience'.",

A jilted lover was found with a harpoon stuck in his own head after stabbing his ex-girlfriend's brother to death in revenge for her leaving him, it has been claimed. Andrew Morris, 30, knifed Henry Stangroom, 21, in the heart at their flat in Battersea, south London, a court heard. Police found Morris with slit wrists and the harpoon sticking out from underneath his chin in the bedroom of the flat. The chef, who worked at the Criterion in Piccadilly Circus, had suffered stab wounds to the heart, lungs and head.

But when Charlotte tried to remove the bar using the plastic slide clips one side became stuck - meaning she had to tug on the bar to work it loose. She says the bar then smashed into her baby's face as it flew out. The little girl's face swelled up, leaving her with a cut forehead and a black eye. Charlotte and partner Ryan Castle, 18, rushed Masie to a minor injuries clinic for a check-up. Doctors told them to watch for signs of brain injury, advising they take Masie home and wake her up every two hours in case she slipped unconsciousness. Charlotte, of Launceston, Cornwall, said: 'The bar is supposed to be removed really easily, and you have to move it to get her out, so it should be safe. 'But it stuck, and of course because you are trying to take it off you are pulling it and it just hit her in the face. She started screaming and screaming. Distraught: Mother Charlotte Priestley, 19, with daughter Masie, who she says has been crying and reaching for her eye since she was wounded . Heartbreaking: 'With a tiny baby you try to do everything right, now we have a baby with a black eye,' Charlotte says . 't was horrible. I felt so helpless. I certainly won't be using it again. I just want other mums to know about it so it doesn't happen to anyone else. 'I was up all night crying. It was horrible. And now we have a baby with a huge black eye, all black and red. 'She is crying all the time and trying to touch her eye, so it is obviously bothering her.It's heartbreaking. 'With such a tiny baby you just try to do everything right, and now we have a baby with a black eye and a cut on her head. Obviously she can't tell us how it feels. It's awful.' First-time mother Charlotte had used the chair for Masie while she sterilised bottles. According to the manufacturer's website the 'precious bouncer' produces 'soothing vibrations and sweet melodies sure to delight your little one'. Safety first: Kids II, the company who manufacture the bouncer, say they 'strive to make products that are enjoyable, but most importantly safe' The couple have since emailed Kids II, the U.S. company who manufacture the Bright Starts chair, to complain. An email to the parents said: 'We are sorry to hear of this report with the Bright Starts Swing. Please let me if your daughter is OK. We always want to ensure the safety of you and your child. 'We thank you for taking the time to notify us and we want to make sure that your child is doing fine and quickly get this resolved for you.' The company, who have contacted Charlotte for more information on the incident, said today that safety was always their prime concern when manufacturing baby products. 'At Kids II we not only strive to make products that are enjoyable but that are most importantly safe for parents and children,' a spokesman said. 'Kids II products meet or exceed all international safety guidelines and regulations. 'As far as the incident you are inquiring about, we are not able to provide a proper response at this time as we have not been able to speak directly with the consumer despite our attempts, nor have we had an opportunity to review the incident as we were just notified earlier today via email.'",

Crazy morning' More than 30 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at the club, which was reopened by Paralympic sailing gold medallist . Helena Lucas last year following a \u00a335,000 renovation. The flames completely . destroyed the vehicle and quickly engulfed the club - turning its white . walls a charcoal grey colour. Mr . Caughey, who served as the commanding officer of the destroyer HMS Fife . between 1982 and 1984, was rescued from his burnt-out car and is . currently being treated at hospital for minor injuries. A . family living at the club at the time of the crash managed to escape . unharmed, while other locals were temporarily evacuated from their . homes. Mr .

Before the crash: The sailing club in Bath Road was reopened last year following a \u00a3350,000 renovation . Athlete: It was officially reopened by Paralympic sailing gold medallist Helena Lucas (pictured at the Olympics) Different view: The impact of the crash today completely destroyed the vehicle - with white replacing its paint . This afternoon, neighbours said Mr Caughey was in the process of moving house - and had appeared 'stressed' in recent weeks. An . estate agent confirmed he exchanged contracts on his old three-bedroom, . detached property, in Emsworth, just a few days ago. It had been listed . for sale for \u00a3795,000. One . neighbour said they believed he was moving to a smaller house half a . mile away - on the same road as the sailing club, of which he was a . member. Another neighbour described the former Navy captain, whose wife Dorothy died nine years ago, as 'a lovely chap' who was close to his two children. The . elderly man, who asked not to be named, said: 'As far as I am aware, he was . in good health, had no money worries, had lots of friends, and a loving . family. Wrecked: More than 30 firefighters tackled the blaze, and the pensioner was rescued from his burnt-out car . Smokey: A family living at the club at the time of the crash managed to escape unharmed, while other locals were temporarily evacuated from their homes. Above, Sarah Jane Walker posts a photo of the blaze on Twitter . 'He . is not the sort of person who would want to harm others, so I can only . imagine it was a tragic accident. 'John had so much to live for so he must have just flipped. It is all very distressing and baffling.' However, neighbour Jean Howells, 72, said Mr Caughey had appeared 'a bit stressed' recently. 'He's lived here for quite a few years now. I know him reasonably well . and he's always been really pleasant, and often says hello,' she said. 'He's a member of the sailing club - as am I. I think he really enjoys it. I saw him the other day in the garden and he seemed okay but I think he has seemed a bit stressed lately. 'He's in the middle of moving house and . all I can think is that it has just got to him - its stressful moving . house anyway and especially if you're on your own.' Mr . Caughey is believed to have put his Prout 31 sailing boat, named . Starquest, up for sale a few years ago for an unknown price. The . advert said: 'Reluctantly, I am putting Starquest up for sale. She . represents excellent value having had more than 50,000 pounds spent on . her in the last four years. 'She has been very lightly used during the past 2 years, due to ill health.' Yacht . club Commodore Mr Clode, 69, who lives next door to the sailing club, . said he had been listening to the radio in bed when he heard the 'massive . bang' this morning. He said he rushed to his bedroom window to see plumes of black smoke billowing from the building. Incident: Mr Caughey, from Emsworth, is now being treated in hospital for minor injuries and has been arrested . 'I . had just switched on the radio at 6.30am when there was a massive . bang,' he said. 'It sounded like someone had dropped a tonne of bricks . into a skip from a great height. It was so loud that at first I thought . the boilers at the club must have exploded. 'I said to my wife: \"What the hell was . that?\" and we looked out of the window to see this huge plume of black . smoke billowing from the club. 'Then we spotted the car embedded in the wall and realised what had happened. I threw on some clothes and ran down to the club. 'The blaze was well alight and the flames were 20ft high. They were licking the very eaves of the building, which was built in . 1875. 'For 10 minutes after the initial bang, there were several smaller bangs coming from the back of the car. Response: The father of two and widower, who later become Queen's Harbour Master at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard, is yet to be formally identified by police. Above, emergency crews remove his vehicle from the scene . Towing it away: This afternoon, neighbours said Mr Caughey had appeared 'stressed' in recent weeks . 'I . don't know what it was but can only describe the noise as like . fireworks. By this point, the driver had been taken out of the car . and was being escorted up the road by two police officers. 'He looked in a very bad way and was taken away in some distress.' Mr . Clode said the crash appeared to have done some great damage to the . sailing club, which was fitted with a new bar, training rooms, . balcony and larger changing rooms during the refurbishment. He added that club members were 'devastated' by the incident, saying: 'The driver was a longstanding member of the club and has many, many friends within the membership. 'There . was absolutely no dispute with other members. What brought this about . we have no idea and we need to find out through his family what brought . this on. 'Everybody at the club is devastated this has happened.' This evening, a police cordon remains in place outside the club to prevent people from getting close to it, while the Volvo V4 has been removed from the scene. Investigators are now working to establish exactly what happened. A Hampshire Fire and Rescue spokesman said: 'We were called to . Emsworth Sailing Club after a car crashed into the building. 'The . driver was rescued from the car and wasn\u2019t hurt. A fire spread from the . car onto the roof of the club and we have teams tackling the fire. 'We have fire crews from Emsworth, Havant, Hayling Island, the Special Equipment Unit from Cosham, and teams from Horndean.

Above, the aftermath of the shocking crash today . 'We also have also got a search and rescue team on stand-by to search the building once the fire is out.' Earlier today, residents in Emsworth said they were saddened by the incident. Will . Wallace, who lives in the small coastal town, told MailOnline: 'This event has shocked many . residents. The sailing club is at the heart of the town. 'Many . Emsworthians are keen sailors and the club provides both that and other . social events. For this to happen in our community is deeply upsetting.' Meanwhile, . eyewitness, Sarah Jane Walker, wrote on Twitter: 'Explosion at sailing . club 6.45 Emsworth. Huge ball of fire, black smoke. Family safe, but . hope everyone else is too.' And . Bianca Jayne-Carr, who also saw the blaze, tweeted: 'Woke up to yelling . this morning after a car crashed into Emsworth Sailing Club. 'Big explosion and the place is in flames. Crazy morning.' The . sailing club has announced it will remain closed for the rest of the . week - and has appealed to members to 'stay away from the club at this . time'. A . Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We were called to an address at . 6:34am this morning following reports that a dark green coloured Volvo . estate was involved in a collision with a building. 'No-one in . the building was injured in the collision and a subsequent fire, the . driver was treated for non-life threatening injuries.

Police will begin scouring a landfill for the body of five-year-old Jhessye Shockley - four months after the youngster was reported missing. It could take Glendale police in Arizona up to six weeks to sift through more than 6,000 tons of trash at Butterfield Station Landfill in Mobile. Authorities believe the body of the child, who was reported missing on October 11, was thrown into a dumpster and transported to the landfill. Scroll down for videos . Investigation: Police will begin searching for the body of five-year-old Jhessye Shockley, who has been missing since October 11, in an Arizona landfill . The search will happy every day, eight hours a day, for up to six weeks . Compacted trash will be spread out over an area of 180 feet by 200 feet for a team to sift through with rakes, The Arizona Republic reported. The search of the specific section of the landfill comes two months after police first considered scouring the dump for the youngster's remains. Jhessye was reported missing in October by her mother Jerice Hunter, who became the primary focus in the police investigation. According to a court document, Jhessye's 13-year-old sister told police her mother kept the girl in a closet, and that Jhessye had black eyes, cuts and bruises before she was reported . missing. The teen recounted an incident just weeks earlier when Hunter returned home to find Jhessye wearing a . long T-shirt while watching TV with a boy. She told the girl . that she was a 'ho' before taking her into a bedroom, according to the . document. Massive site: Search teams will sift through 6,000 tons of trash for the body . Hopeful: Police say they know the exact date the body was dumped and where . The teen said she could hear her sister screaming and crying in the room, the document said. She also told police that Hunter kept . Jhessye in a bedroom closet and deprived her of food and water, according to the document. '(She) reported that Jhessye's hair . had been pulled out and described Jhessye as not looking alive and that . she looked like a zombie,' it said. '(She) said that the . closet where Jhessye had been looked like a grave and smelled like dead . people.' The teen said Hunter placed incense in a container to conceal the odor. She also said that a few days before . Jhessye disappeared, her mother spent the entire day cleaning the . apartment and cleaning her shoes from the closet with soap and bleach. Police said they found a receipt that showed Hunter bought food and a . bottle of bleach two days before she reported her daughter missing. In court: Jhessye's mother Jerice Hunter is the primary focus of the investigation. She appeared in court on child abuse charges and is held on a $100,000 bail . Hunter was arrested on a felony count . of child abuse, more than five weeks after she reported Jhessye's disappearance. Hunter was held on a $100,000 bond and has appeared in court, where she has protested her innocence. Hunter claims she went out for an errand and left the girl in the . care of three older siblings at their apartment. AZCentral.com reported the sister said the last time she saw Jhessye . was September 12. The report says school records indicate Jhessy'e last . day at school was September 22. Police have said they no longer expect to find the five-year-old alive. A spokesman told the Arizona Republic that authorities are determined to search as long as it takes to find the body. 'Cruel parents': Jerice Hunter (left) was also arrested on earlier child abuse charges in October 2005 with then-husband, George . Shockley, (right) 'That means ripping every single bag, going through everything,' said the spokesman. Police told ABC15.com that 40 people will work eight hours a day on the operation. Glendale Police Chief Steve Conrad added: 'We would love nothing more than to find . Jhessye and hold the person who is responsible for her death . accountable. I feel we owe . that to her, her family and the community.' Police were unable to recover bodies during two searches of the same landfill in the late 90s. Lisa Vance, who helped raise the girl while her mother served time in prison for child abuse, told The Republic: 'I'm very confident that when they go out there, however many days it takes, they are going to find Jhessye. They just have to.' But Hunter's attorney, Scott Maasen, expressed surprise that authorities had not launched the search sooner. Worrying: Jhessye vanished from her hometown of Glendale without a trace . 'They said almost two months ago they . were possibly going to search the landfill,' he said. 'It begs the . question, why has there been a delay for so long?' Police claim they spent recent months figuring out the specific day they believe the body was dumped so a search would be more successful. Hunter, whom police have named as a 'number one' interest in the case, has also been critical of the investigation into finding her daughter: . She said in December: 'We feel that law enforcement is not . active in finding Jhessye and that they're more active in persecuting me . instead of finding out where she is. State Child Protective Services . removed Hunter's other children, including a newborn, from her apartment in November. See below for videos .",

Her 'redneck' parents may have been accused of child abuse in March but it seems the show must go on for young pageant star Honey Boo Boo. In the latest episode of her reality series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, the six-year-old is seen gushing over her pet pig named Glitzy. But sadly, the new clip for the upcoming episode, which airs on Wednesday night on TLC, shows her mother June telling the camera that she wants to remove her daughter's beloved playmate from their McIntyre, Georgia home. Scroll down for video . Best friends: Honey Boo Boo (left) and her pet pig Glitzy (right) are threatened to be torn apart in a new episode of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Her mother June is sick of the pig waking her up in the morning . Alana, who was the break-out star of the controversial reality series Toddlers & Tiaras, is seen petting her pig on her bed in the clip seen on Radaronline.com. She tells it: 'We're going to be the prettiest girls at the pageant and there's no way we can't win cause I've got me a pig, how about that?' The youngster, who is clearly besotted by her pet, then places a tiny tiara on the animal's head, calling Glitzy her 'baby'. June, who is known as the coupon queen and was arrested on January 3, 2008 for theft and contempt of court, is then shown telling the cameras how infuriated she is by the animal's early morning sounds.

The look on the 33-year-old's face can only be described as disgust. A similarly unhappy expression was seen upon June's face when she posed for a mugshot in 2008. The mugshot surfaced last week as well as details of her arrest which took place in Henry County, Georgia. According to Starcasm, there are also additional court reports which show that she was the defendant in two child support cases around the same time, which may explain the theft charges, although it is not entirely clear.

The family were visited by the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services in March, according to The National Enquirer. A source told the magazine that authorities who made the visit 'found reason to bring the case to court' but a 'court-appointed attorney' for June convinced the judge to 'throw it [the case] out'. The source said investigators were called to the home as a result of June and Mr Thompson's unorthodox, and highly-publicised, parenting methods which include feeding Alana caffeinated drinks as well as roadkill for dinner. Controversy: The parents of pageant star Honey Boo Boo (front) were accused of child abuse according to a new report.

Here Comes Honey Boo Boo has has also showed Alana go mud belly flop diving, attend local food auctions with June and help her buy more than a dozen packets of chocolate milk powder, during one supermarket visit, using discount coupons. The source who spoke with The National Enquirer added: 'Honey Boo Boo's upbringing raised eyebrows with neighbors.' The initial visit by authorities is said to have occurred 'shortly after filming began' on the new TLC series which premiered on August 8. It attracted 2.2million viewers. Although June sparked outrage back in January when she was seen on Toddlers & Tiaras feeding Alana 'Go Go Juice', a mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull, the authorities visited the family after catching wind of an online video that showed Alana dancing for dollars in a bar. Secret weapon: The youngster, who was first seen on Toddlers & Tiaras, was fed 'Go Go Juice' by June. The mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull was offered to the little girl after she had consumed 15 packets of sugar . Crazy: Once she had consumed the Juice, she was seen spinning around on the floor, her energy heightened . Loud and proud: The pageant queen showed off her flabby belly on a previous episode of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. The child has been shown to feast on roadkill and ample sugary sweets on several occasions . The video, which can still be found on YouTube, was not filmed by the network however showed Alana in a darkened room, dancing atop of table as colored lights flash around her. June defended her daughter's actions by explaining that Alana had been dancing in a college bar, not a sleazy one. The 'Go Go Juice' incident, which saw Alana being fed the liquid after having downed 15 bags of Pixy Stix, tubes of powdered sugar commonly referred to as 'pageant crack', attracted negative criticism of its own. June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an . unlabelled bottle. Within seconds, the change was apparent and the . pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and . spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My Go Go juice is kicking in . right now!' Beauty pageant insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol. Lewd: June was seen in the debut episode of her new reality series, grinding up against a young man . Stealing the limelight: June (left) has arguably become more of a focus in the reality show than her beauty pageant star daughter (right). The pair were seen on CNN earlier this month promoting the new TLC show . Describing how . the drink made her feel, Alana said: 'Go Go juice makes me laughy, and . play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.' June has stolen much of the limelight away from her daughter in the new reality series. During its debut episode, she was seen grinding up against a young man as her daughter played in a giant mud pit. She has also been filmed taking her family to the supermarket to help her shop using discount coupons and take Alana to their local food auction, June's favourite weekly activity, in order to bid on what appeared to be sugary donuts. She has also admitted that she is obsessed with 'couponing', labeling it 'better than sex' in a teaser for tonight's new episode of the reality series. The coupon queen, as she is commonly referred to, continued: 'Couponing is a serious obsession. Anybody who uses coupons will tell you that it is an addiction.'",

A leaked copy of a United Nations report, compiled by hundreds of scientists, shows politicians in Belgium, Germany, Hungary and the United States raised concerns about the final draft. Published next week, it is expected to address the fact that 1998 was the hottest year on record and world temperatures have not yet exceeded it, which scientists have so far struggled to explain. The report is the result of six years\u2019 work by UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is seen as the world authority on the extent of climate change and what is causing it \u2013 on which governments including Britain\u2019s base their green policies. Concerns: Scientists have been urged to cover up the fact that the Earth's temperature hasn't risen for the last 15 years amid fears it would provide ammunition for deniers of man-made climate change . But leaked documents seen by the Associated Press, yesterday revealed deep concerns among politicians about a lack of global warming over the past few years. Germany called for the references to the slowdown in warming to be deleted, saying looking at a time span of just 10 or 15 years was \u2018misleading\u2019 and they should focus on decades or centuries. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has changed its tune after issuing stern warnings about climate change for years . Hungary worried the report would provide ammunition for deniers of man-made climate change. Belgium objected to using 1998 as a starting year for statistics, as it was exceptionally warm and makes the graph look flat - and suggested using 1999 or 2000 instead to give a more upward-pointing curve. The United States delegation even weighed in, urging the authors of the report to explain away the lack of warming using the \u2018leading hypothesis\u2019 among scientists that the lower warming is down to more heat being absorbed by the ocean \u2013 which has got hotter. The last IPCC \u2018assessment report\u2019 was published in 2007 and has been the subject of huge controversy after it had to correct the embarrassing claim that the Himalayas would melt by 2035. It was then engulfed in the \u2018Climategate\u2019 scandal surrounding leaked emails allegedly showing scientists involved in it trying to manipulate their data to make it look more convincing \u2013 although several inquiries found no wrongdoing. The latest report, which runs to 2,000 pages, will be shown to representatives from all 195 governments next week at a meeting in Stockholm, who can discuss alterations they want to make. But since it was issued to governments in June, they have raised hundreds of objections about the 20-page summary for policymakers, which sums up the findings of the scientists. What it says will inform renewable energy policies and how much consumers and businesses will pay for them. The report is expected to say the rate of warming between 1998 and 2012 was about half of the average rate since 1951 \u2013 and put this down to natural variations such as the El Nino and La Nina ocean cycles and the cooling effects of volcanoes. A leaked copy of the United Nations report, compiled by hundreds of scientists, shows politicians in Belgium, Germany, Hungary and the United States have raised concerns about the final draft. Above, the United Nations headquarters building in New York . A German climate scientist - Stefan Rahmstorf, who reviewed the chapter on sea levels - yesterday admitted it was possible the report\u2019s authors were feeling under pressure to address the slowdown in warming due to the \u2018public debate\u2019 around the issue. The draft report, which is not new research but a synthesis of all the work being done by scientists around the world, is likely to be highly disputed at the three-day meeting. It will make the case that humans are causing global warming with carbon emissions even more strongly upgrading it from \u2018very likely\u2019 in 2007 to \u2018extremely likely\u2019 it is manmade. But scientists are under pressure to explain why the warming has not exceeded 1998 levels although the decade 2000-2010 was the hottest on record. Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists based in Washington, said yesterday: \u2018I think to not address it would be a problem because then you basically have the denialists saying: \u2018Look the IPCC is silent on this issue.\u2019 Jonathan Lynn, a spokesman for the IPCC said yesterday: \u2018This is the culmination of four years\u2019 work by hundreds of scientists, where governments get a chance to ensure the summary for policymakers is clear and concise in a dialogue with the scientists who wrote it, and have the opportunity to raise any topics they think should be highlighted.\u2019",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\n(CNN)Last week, I had the privilege to greet a group of about 100 Ebola survivors who were meeting at the ELWA Hospital chapel: the very structure that, seven months ago, was Monrovia's first Ebola treatment unit. The group was diverse \u2014 elderly, young people, even little children.  Some educated, some not.  Roughly equal numbers of men and women; some dressed up in nice clothes, some in T-shirts, shorts and flip-flops.  Some were clearly feeling happy just to have survived Ebola, with smiles on their faces, while others looked like they were still experiencing some of the trauma and stigma of Ebola: faces downcast, not making eye contact. As I met them, tears welled up in my eyes. These people had gotten through Ebola just like I had, but here in Liberia, where the resources, staff and treatment available were so much more limited. The gathering was initiated by the Christian Health Association of Liberia, a local nongovernmental organization that has received funding to help Ebola survivors. They were meeting with some of the survivors from the ELWA 2 Ebola Treatment Unit in order to share a modest cash benefit, intended to help survivors rebuild their lives: replacing mattresses, clothes, furniture and phones, finding new employment, and trying to fit back into their communities. They also met with Dr. John Fankhauser, another missionary doctor at ELWA. He let them know about a free survivors' clinic at ELWA Hospital to address complications of Ebola, such as nerve damage or vision problems. On the national level, the Ebola Survivors Association of Liberia is well-organized, considering the brief time frame. It has a president, who presented me with his business card at the meeting. There are estimated to be about 1,500 Ebola survivors in Liberia. In partnership with several international organizations, the association advocates for survivors' mental and physical needs, and educates the public about Ebola survivors to help reduce stigma. A few days earlier, I had met with another group of survivors: the ELWA Hospital Support Group for People Living with HIV/AIDS. This was quite a different meeting. There were about 15 people there, many of whom I know well from having worked with them and treated them over the years since the program began in 2001. Now that the Ebola crisis is subsiding, they want to revitalize the group, which at times has had 80 to 100 people involved. In the past, ELWA Hospital staff ran the support group and decided how to facilitate its activities, using funds from SIM.   But now these long-term clients \u2014 they are all on anti-retroviral therapy,  some for years \u2014 want to become more independent, to be given more discretion to strategize and make decisions about how to use funding that is available. This was such an interesting and eye-opening discussion for me. Early on, when we were just starting ELWA's treatment program for HIV, many of these clients were quite ill, and needed nutritional support, medication and health care, and help with transportation to appointments and support group meetings. Now the group has matured: Many are very stable on their medication and really thriving. At this stage, they feel the need to be treated as equal partners rather than only recipients of charity. They want more input as to how the group might benefit from funds that come in. When a donation was made by SIM to the group about six weeks ago, they chose to make soap for laundry and dishes from locally sourced lye and palm oil, to sell it as a fundraising activity. The balls of soap sell for about 12 cents each.  The group has sold most of the first batch, and they are projecting a profit of about 25% over the cost of raw materials. They want to continue soap production, using the profits to help members of the group start businesses or attend college or other training programs. When I see the spark of initiative and determination in these people who were once so sick and discouraged with their condition, I get a new sense of what might be possible for them. What were the key ingredients in developing that spark?  Our relationship started with unconditional love, and a real personal connection, as well as provision for some key practical needs, including sound medical care. And now it requires a readiness, and a means, to shift from charity to partnership. During the West African Ebola crisis, we have seen that Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, some of the least developed nations on the continent, did not have the capacity to fight the epidemic on their own. While the initial response to Ebola required massive direct aid and assistance, let's hope that we can also move on to real partnership in helping develop a locally led and driven health system that can do better at protecting its people from the next outbreak.",

For decades, passport applicants have been required to provide details of their mother and father. But now, after pressure from the gay lobby, they will be given the option of naming \u2018parent 1\u2019 and \u2018parent 2\u2019. The change, which is due to take place within weeks, has been made following claims the original form was \u2018discriminatory\u2019 and failed to include same-sex couples looking after a child. It has led to claims the official travel document is being turned into a \u2018PC passport\u2019. Campaigners for family values said the move \u2018denigrated\u2019 the roles of parents bringing up children in traditional families. Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said: \u2018Fathers and mothers are not interchangeable but have quite distinct roles to play in the care and nurture of their children. \u2018To speak of \u201cparent 1\u201d and \u201cparent 2\u201d denigrates the place of both fathers and mothers. \u2018Much as the equality and diversity social engineers might wish it were otherwise, it still takes a father and a mother to produce a child.\u2019 The Identity and Passport Service insisted it was necessary to incorporate same-sex parents on the form so that accurate information is collected . The decision follows the revelation . last month that details of the holder\u2019s sex could be erased from all . passports to spare transgender people from embarrassment. The proposals are the latest shake-up to established rules for passports. Last month, the Daily Mail revealed that the Government is preparing to introduce passports without details of the holder\u2019s gender. It would spare transgender people and those with both male and female organs from having to tick \u2018male\u2019 or \u2018female\u2019 boxes. Supporters say it will solve the problem of embarrassing situations at border controls, where people whose sex appears to differ from that in their passport undergo questioning from guards. As the rules stand, everyone must identify themselves as a man or women, even when they are undergoing sex-change therapy. But, following pressure from the Lib Dems, the Home Office has begun a consultation on changing the rules. The . latest shift follows lobbying from gay rights groups, who argue that . the current passport application form fails to recognise same-sex . couples who are both officially registered as a child\u2019s parents. Documents seen by the Daily Mail suggest the change was made as a result of lobbying by the gay rights group Stonewall. The Home Office \u2018Diversity Strategy\u2019 states: \u2018IPS [the Identity and Passport Service] is working with . Stonewall in response to an issue about having to name a \u201cmother\u201d and . \u201cfather\u201d on the passport application form.\u2019 Mr Wells added: \u2018Like the Labour administration before it, the Coalition seems to be in Stonewall\u2019s grip. \u2018It is high time ministers started to . represent the interests of the country as a whole and not capitulate to . every demand made by a vocal and unrepresentative minority.\u2019 Gay couples are registered as the official parents of any child they adopt. Those who use surrogate mothers must apply to the courts for a \u2018parental order\u2019 in order to be recognised as a child\u2019s official parents. Similar changes have been made in recent months to passport application forms in the U.S., outraging traditional family groups and religious conservatives. Officials accepted that the move was made following lobbying from gay rights groups who claimed it was discriminatory. But a spokesman for the Identity and Passport Service insisted it was necessary to incorporate same-sex parents on the form so that accurate information is collected. He said: \u2018IPS is planning to amend the application form and associated guidance to deal with same-sex parents applying for a passport on behalf of a child. \u2018Currently, the application form provides the relevant boxes of \u201cmother\u201d and \u201cfather\u201d to be completed. \u2018The new form to be introduced by December 2011 will in addition provide for \u201cparent 1\u201d and \u201cparent 2\u201d. \u2018It is essential that any parent provides the necessary information on their status as parents or guardians when applying for a passport on behalf of their child. 'This protects the interests of the child and ensures that IPS is able to issue passports securely and safely to the right person. \u2018The passport application form is therefore being updated to incorporate same-sex parents.\u2019 Gay lobbyists and politicians have long claimed that 10 per cent of the population is homosexual. But figures from the Office for National Statistics last week suggest that this is a wild exaggeration. According to the Integrated Household Survey, homosexuals and bisexuals make up only 1.5 per cent of the population. One per cent said they were gay or lesbian, while 0.5 per cent said they were bisexual. More men than women declared themselves homosexual, with 1.3 per cent of men saying they were gay compared with 0.6 per cent of women who described themselves as lesbian. Some 94 per cent said they were heterosexual, 4.3 per cent declined to answer the question or said they did not know, and 0.4 per cent said their sexuality was \u2018other\u2019.",

A Shenyang court accepted the case, making it the first lawsuit against an airline for discriminating against an HIV-positive person in China, the Global Times said. \u2018The court's acceptance of this case signalled that HIV carriers can protect their rights through legal channels,\u2019 it quoted plaintiff Cheng Shuaishuai as saying. On its website, Spring Airlines states that it has the right to refuse passage to those with \u2018infectious diseases\u2019. According the Fazhi Evening Paper, the three passengers were preparing to board a flight on 28 July when they were stopped by airline officials. One passenger told the paper: \u2018After we got our boarding passes, we informed a Spring Airlines official that some of us had HIV. \u2018The official immediately rang up the Shanghai head office for instructions, and then told us the company has rules forbidding the transportation of passengers with HIV.\u2019 The passenger said their tickets were cancelled and they were forced to take a train to their destination. China only lifted a long-standing ban on HIV-positive foreigners entering the country in 2010. Under Chinese law, airlines can refuse to allow anyone with an \u2018infectious\u2019 condition to board their planes. However, according to the BBC, Liu Wei, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said the airline had no evidence the three passengers\u2019 presence would infect anyone else.

Activists say the annual Turkish Gay Pride Parade, now in its ninth year, is the only march of its kind in a majority-Muslim country. Several thousand supporters of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights carried signs and rainbow flags as they made their way down one of Istanbul's busiest pedestrian thoroughfares. Participants chanted slogans against harassment and blew whistles, waved large rainbow flags and carried signs in Turkish and English that sported messages like \"We're everywhere, get used to it\" and \"Dance, dance, against homophobia, dance.\" Other signs referenced Ahmet Yildiz, a 26-year-old who was shot to death in Istanbul in 2008. Yildiz's father has been accused of traveling almost 600 miles to shoot him in what has been called an \"honor killing.\" According to Yildiz's partner, Ibo, Yildiz sought protection from prosecutors after receiving threats of violence from his family. His case was featured in an Amnesty International report on the status of gays, lesbians, and transsexuals in Turkey titled \"Not An Illness, Nor A Crime.\" The report says it later emerged that the prosecutor's office erroneously transferred the complaint to another office and failed to investigate the claims, in what some activists view as the unwillingness of the authorities to confront homophobic violence. Sunday's march blurred ethnic and religious lines. A group of about 20 Kurdish activists, fleeing police tear gas that was fired at an unrelated nearby political demonstration, were greeted by a round of applause as they joined the colorful crowd. Tear gas from the same demonstration wafted over parts of the crowd, causing the march to stall briefly as people took cover to stave off its effects. Gay rights organizations have accused Turkey's government of expressing hostile attitudes toward the country's homosexual community. Activists point to a statement made by Aliye Kavaf, Turkey's minister for women and family affairs. \"I believe homosexuality is a biological disorder, an illness, and should be treated,\" she said in a 2010 interview with the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet. One parade-goer, who was a part of a tango group moving through the crowd, wore a bright red head scarf with a checkered red, black, and white tie as she danced with her partner. The dancer, who wears a head scarf in daily life, said that Islam and homosexuality are not incongruous. \"Religion is not a fixed thing,\" said Iz, who declined to provide her last name. \"It has been interpreted throughout history, is still being interpreted and it needs to evolve.\" In accession talks with the European Union, Turkey has been gradually improving its record on homosexuality as it makes changes to conform to EU policy on human rights laws. Many marchers on Sunday came out to improve social consciousness of homosexuality. \"The big-bellied, mustached men are looking, trying to figure out what's going on. They're learning what a rainbow is,\" said Natalie Aslan, 23.",

Douglas Warstler filed his lawsuit against Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington in Georgia State Court in Fulton County on Monday. All three previously attended Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, and were fraternity brothers at Kappa Alpha - where Buffington was Warstler\u2019s \u2018big brother\u2019. Yik Yak founders Brooks Buffington, left, and Tyler Droll, right, are being sued by their former college friend who claims he was unfairly dumped from their business venture . Warstler and Droll were both computer science majors and became close after building an app together in class. The app didn\u2019t take off but it prompted the three friends to form Locus Engineering, a development company that was divided evenly between the three of them. A second app called Dicho also flopped, but included the ability to post anonymously \u2013 a key feature of Yik Yak, which allows people to create and view posts in secret within a 1.5 mile radius. In his lawsuit, Warstler claims that he developed this key feature. By October 2013, Droll and Buffington had graduated and were living in Atlanta, while Warstler was still at school. The suit says he played a crucial role in marketing the app - now called Yik Yak - among other students at Furman, where it quickly proved very popular. Douglas Warstler, right, claims he was responsible for developing the technology behind Yik Yak, left, that allows users to post anonymously within a 1.5 mile radius . Just before Christmas, Buffington texted Warstler and offered to buy him out of the company. Days later, on December 28, Buffington emailed Warstler to tell him he was \u2018not getting screwed out of anything,\u2019 but that he needed to give up his part of the company. 'We need a fresh start with your name off of this [Yik Yak],' the email said, according to the suit. 'I spoke with my parents over the holidays. They are making me get this settled before continuing to fund it.' Warstler refused and by January 6, Buffington and Droll had dissolved the company without warning him. 'We have decided that our best course of action is to dissolve Locus Engineering and set up a new LLC for Yik Yak,' said Buffington via another email, according to the suit. 'Between Brooks and I, we jointly own all of the intellectual property of Yik Yak and Locus Engineering has no stake in it.' Since January, the app has proved hugely successful with users and investors alike. It is one of the most downloaded apps this year and used on more than 1300 college campuses. Former friends: All three previously attended Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, and were fraternity brothers at Kappa Alpha - where Buffington, right was Warstler\u2019s, left, 'big brother' By June it had secured $10 million in venture capital funding, although recent reports suggest it may have raised around $75 million in new financing. Warstler's lawsuit asks for one-third of Yik Yak to be returned to him along with punitive damages, compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees. 'He started this company together with them and with the understanding that they\u2019d be developing and marketing different iPhone applications,' Warstler's lawyer Luan Tran told Forbes. 'Yik Yak was the second application that they started to work on together. The first one was not a success. He was responsible for Yik Yak going viral at Furman which was the Ground Zero or the testing area for this application.' Tran recently represented ousted Snapchat cofounder Reggie Brown in his lawsuit against the former fraternity brothers who ousted him from the messaging app, which is valued at $10 billion. Warstler's claims will be all too familiar to the Winklevoss brothers, who were dubbed the 'Wiklevii' in Facebook movie The Social Network . In September,\u00a0Chief Executive Evan Spiegel and Chief Technology Officer Robert Murphy acknowledged that Brown had been integral to the birth of app. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but Brown had been seeking a third and\u00a0Tran had told Forbes that  he and his client were seeking 'over a billion dollars' in damages. The claims of start-up skulduggery will also be all too familiar to the Winklevoss brothers, who were dubbed the \u2018Wiklevii\u2019 in the Facebook movie The Social Network. It was in 2003 that they claimed they asked Mark Zuckerberg to write the code on their own social network, called Harvard Connection. They alleged that he then started his own rival called thefacebook.com which went on to become the biggest website of its kind in the world with more than one billion users. Whilst they were given their $65 million settlement Zuckerberg has gone on to become one of the richest men in the world. Warstler is currently a master\u2019s student at Vanderbilt University.",

President Mohamed Morsy said the statements, made in 2010, were about Israeli aggression against Palestinians in Gaza, not about the Jewish people, according to a statement published in Egypt News. U.S. senators visiting Cairo on Wednesday confronted him about the comments, according to one of the senators. \"In our meeting with President Morsy, we voiced our strong disapproval of statements he made a few years ago that have recently surfaced,\" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said in a written statement. \"We had a constructive discussion on this subject. We leave it to the president to make any further comments on this matter that he may wish.\" The congressional trip also included Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina; Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island; Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York; Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut; and Chris Coons, D-Delaware. The group met with leadership, business and other Egyptian groups. Morsy told the American delegation he is committed to respecting religions, and to the principle of freedom of belief and religious practice. Morsy backs Syrian calls for al-Assad to face war crimes . \"President Morsy also added that it's necessary to separate between Judaism and the Jewish people, and the violent practices against the unarmed Palestinians and the assaults on their lives and properties,\" according to the Egyptian News report. On Tuesday, the Obama administration strongly condemned Morsy's recorded comments and called on him to repudiate what he said. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland called the comments \"deeply offensive ... language that espouses religious hatred.\" In the recording, Morsy says Arabs and Muslims \"must cut off all relations with this plundering criminal entity\" and \"besiege the Zionists,\" whom he calls \"bloodsuckers,\" \"warmongers\" and \"descendants of apes and pigs.\" \"We want to see President Morsy make absolutely clear to his own people, to the international community that he respects people of all faiths,\" Nuland said on Tuesday. The White House, in a clearly coordinated statement, also condemned Morsy's statements. Spokesman Jay Carney told reporters, \"This kind of discourse has been acceptable in the region for far too long and is counter to the goal of peace. President Morsy should make clear that he respects people of all faiths and that this type of rhetoric is not acceptable or productive in a democratic Egypt.\" The comments, which Morsy made as a then-leader of the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, immediately raised questions about whether he can be trusted to respect Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Even as she condemned Morsy's remarks, the State Department spokeswoman noted that since he has been president, Morsy \"has reaffirmed again, and again\" Egypt's commitment to peace with Israel. \"He has been willing to work with us, and with Israel, on shared objectives, including the cease-fire in Gaza,\" Nuland said. \"He's been committed to our bilateral relationship. So ... that is the basis on which we are continuing to work together going forward.\" She added, however, \"We will judge him by what he does ... but we'll also judge him by ... what he says. And we think that these comments should be repudiated and they should be repudiated firmly.\" Asked whether Morsy's comments could damage relations with the United States, Nuland said U.S. officials hope that making the administration's views clear to the Egyptian leader and inducing him to publicly step away from his comments might tamp down what could be an angry reaction from members of Congress. She told reporters, \"We certainly have made the Egyptians aware that we are continuing to seek economic support funds for Egypt on the Hill, and they are very well aware that these kinds of issues are of concern there, too.\" Last autumn, Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, chairwoman of the Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, placed a hold on $450 million in U.S. economic support for Egypt after that nation cracked down on democracy support groups.",

Scientists and legal experts have raised concerns that an ambitious experiment using a super-charged ion collider could accidentally destroy planet Earth. One of the world\u2019s most powerful particle accelerators, which is capable of generating particles hotter than four trillion degrees Celsius, has come under the spotlight after experts have warned that micro black holes and strange matter could be generated. The Brookhaven National Laboratory\u2019s Realistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) accelerates nuclei to the speed of light, before smashing them together in a bid to create quark-gluon plasma, which is an incredibly hot substance thought to have occurred just after the Big Bang. Scroll down for video . Scientists and legal experts have raised concerns that an ambitious experiment at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, using a super-charged ion collider, could accidentally destroy planet Earth (illustrated) While the experiment could help to answer questions about how life started on Earth, critics, including the Astronomer Royal, have warned that subatomic particles called \u2018strangelets\u2019 could be created accidentally . These particles have the potential to start a chain reaction and change everything into \u2018strange matter,\u2019 which Martin Rees said could transform Earth into \u2018an inert hyperdense sphere about one hundred metres across\u2019. The RHIC \u2013 the world\u2019s second most powerful particle accelerator after Cern\u2019s Large hadron Collider (LHC) -\u00a0 is about to get a massive upgrade to boost its power and push experiments into uncharted waters. The Brookhaven National Laboratory\u00bfs Realistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) pictured, accelerates nuclei to the speed of light, before smashing them together in a bid to create quark-gluon plasma, which is an incredibly hot substances thought to have occurred just after the Big Bang . With the upgrade, the RHIC will be able to generate collisions 20 times stronger than when it was originally built, prompting legal experts to question whether the facility also needs to perform a more thorough risk assessment. Eric Johnson, Associate Professor of Law at the University of North Dakota and Michael Baram, Professor Emeritus at Boston University Law School wrote in a piece for the International Business Times that the facility should be re-evaluated for its potential to create a huge scale disaster that could wipe out life on Earth. Since the RHIC was built, scientists have discovered the Higgs boson as well as quark-gluon plasma, which is not like anything that humans have ever known. The two legal experts argue that same commission that has recently probed the cost of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s labs, should also \u2018take a sober look at one experimental programme that raises a bizarre and little-discussed prospect of destroying the entire planet.\u2019 The RHIC, the world's second most powerful particle accelerator after Cern's LHC,  is about to get a massive upgrade to boost its power and push experiments into uncharted waters. The Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) - a detector that tracks the particles produced by each ion collision - is pictured . Scientists are worried that micro black holes and \u2018strangelets\u2019 could be created. Strangelets are a hypothetical form of quark matter that in specific conditions could trigger a chain reaction to convert everything else to strange matter and destroy the planet. Professors Baram and Johnson are particularly concerned that low energy experiments could boost the risk of creating strangelets and a recent report has shown that mini black holes can be generated from less energy than originally thought. There were similar concerns when Cern\u2019s LHC began its quest to find the \u2018God particle,\u2019 even though it is unlikely that stable black holes can be created by particle accelerators and even if they were, they could not suck in matter in a way that could threaten the planet, iO9 reported. Two legal experts have called for a risk assessment to look into the risks of producing catestrophic chain reactions at national laboratories, including Brookhaven. The PHENIX detector at the RHIC is pictured. It records many different particles emerging from RHIC collisions, including quark-containing particles called hadrons . Where there were a number of reports investigating the chances of a catastrophic chain reaction arising from experiments, the legal duo pointed out that they were published more than six years ago and things have changes since then. Professors Baram and Johnson wrote: \u2018The original [RHIC] report assumed the RHIC would only run for a planned 10 years. But thanks to program extensions, the RHIC is now entering its 15th year. \u2018The machine has also been continuously upgraded since the report...The suitability of models and assumptions used in the original analysis might be profitably reappraised.\u2019 They have called for 'rigorous, independent risk analysis it [the RHIC] has long warranted.\u2019 In August 2012 physicists at CERN's Large Hadron Collider broke a record by achieving the hottest man-made temperatures ever - 100,000 times hotter than the interior of the Sun. Scientists there collided lead ions to create a searingly hot sub-atomic soup known as quark-gluon plasma at about 5.5trillion degrees Celsius, the hottest temperature ever recorded in an experiment. It was about 40 per cent hotter than the old record, set by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York, by smashing gold ions together. Scientists believe that at the point in our universe's history quarks and gluons \u2013 basic building blocks of matter \u2013 were not confined inside composite particles such as protons and neutrons, as they are today. Instead, they moved freely in a state of matter known as 'quark\u2013gluon plasma'. Collisions of lead ions in the LHC, the world\u2019s most powerful particle accelerator, recreate for a fleeting moment conditions similar to those of the early universe. By examining a billion or so of these collisions, the experiments were able to make more precise measurements of the properties of matter under these extreme conditions.",

As experts try to get to the heart of this complex and delicate structure, excavation works have revealed the large floor mosaic, 10-feet wide and 15-feet long, full of tiny pebbles of white, black, blue, red and yellow. Other finds inside the tomb include two magnificent caryatids, sculpted female figures like those found at the Acropolis in Athens. Each figure has one arm stretched, as if to keep intruders out of the main chamber. With every find revealing the further wealth of the tomb, excitement grows as to who was buried at the site. Dating from the fourth century BC, obvious links lead to Alexander the Great. Some say it may be the king's wife, Roxane, or his mother, Olympias. And while historic accounts show that Alexander is buried elsewhere, his tomb has not been found, fueling further speculation. Since the excavation began in August, hundreds of tourists and local day-trippers have flocked to Amphipolis hoping to catch a glimpse of the site, while local media are filled with lengthy reports of the archaeologists progress. Bets and sweepstakes have also appeared to guess the occupant of the tomb, some less serious than others, with names like \"Indiana Jones\" popping up. A visit to the site by Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, who has described it as very important, has increased local certainty about the significance of the tomb. Despite what historians say, there are many who argue that only Alexander could be buried in such opulence. The government is warning against unfounded reports but at the same time continues fueling public interest, with almost daily reports from Amphipolis on state broadcaster Nerit. Broadsheet Kathimerini in an article this week wondered whether the \"Amphipolis Syndrome\" is largely a product of the financial crisis that the country has been experiencing for the last six years. The crisis \"did not only dry social funds and pockets but also revealed a cultural deficit,\" the newspaper said. It questioned whether this is an attempt to restore Greece's tarnished image and boost national pride and morale that includes elements of a strategy that will see the government's popularity increase at a time when polls put ruling New Democracy 10 percentage points behind the main opposition, leftist Syriza. There is such a wealth of heritage in Greece, often referred to as \"the cradle of civilization,\" that there is no denying that antiquity remains one of its strongest cards, and with tourism being its second largest moneymaker after shipping, the country is keen to promote it further. Only days ago at a presentation at the Archaeological Museum of Greece's second city, Thessaloniki, a team of Greek experts  confirmed that bones found in a royal tomb at Vergina, also close to Amphipolis, are those of the Macedonian King Philip II, Alexander the Great's father. As Greece looks to the past to move forward at a time of crisis, it is also preparing to bring back to the limelight a cultural cause celebre, that of the Parthenon marbles housed at the British Museum in London. Greece says they were removed illegally and is asking for their repatriation. Three prominent lawyers have arrived in Greece for talks with the government to explore the legal route for the marbles' return. And there are few people who are likely to attract more attention than the youngest of the three, 36-year-old Amal Alamuddin, who recently became Mrs. George Clooney after marrying the Hollywood star in Venice. The Oscar-winning actor took the audience by surprise when he called on Britain to return the marbles to Greece in February during a news conference for his film \"The Monuments Men,\" which deals with the recovery of artworks stolen by the Nazis. Responding to a question by a Greek reporter, he said, \"I think you have a very good case to make about your artifacts.\" Alamuddin has been involved in the issue since 2011, yet her high-profile visit, her first public viewing since her marriage with Clooney, is expected to further raise international interest in Greece's antiquity.",

He kept them in his attic for 30 years and only realised their true value recently . Arthur Maxted inherited the collection from his grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war. Mr Maxted has kept the posters in the loft of his home in Kent for the past 30 years, forgetting all about them, and only realised their true importance recently when he started researching and documenting the collection. Now, 100 years on from the outbreak of the war the posters are being sold at auction and have a pre-sale estimate of \u00a320,000. 'The posters were collected by my maternal grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war,' said 72-year-old Mr Maxted. 'It is a mystery as to why he kept hold of them, as they were not of any monetary worth back then. Collection: 100 years on from the outbreak of the war the posters, such as this one which urged men of all backgrounds to enlist, are being sold at auction and have a pre-sale estimate of \u00a320,000 . Justice: These two posters feature Britannia and urge men to recall the deadly December 1914 raid by the Imperial German navy on Scarborough (left) and the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 that cost 1198 lives (right) Anger: This poster (left) also recalls the sinking of the Lusitania as well as other wartime atrocities, while a 1917 design sought to remind men that others, including women and children, were doing their bit . 'My aunt passed them on to me about 30 years ago and they spent many years in my loft. 'It was only recently that I started to document them and realised they might be quite valuable.' The posters were the brainchild of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, a board set up in the early days of the war to bolster the number of British troops. They were displayed in public areas around towns and cities like train and bus stations and on billboards and hoardings. Change: When it became clear victory was more than a matter of months away, enthusiasm dwindled and recruitment posters quickly turned to emotional blackmail, playing on the conscience of working men who had yet to volunteer . Mission: The posters were the brainchild of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, a board set up in the early days of the war to bolster the number of British troops, and were displayed in public areas around towns and cities like train and bus stations and on billboards and hoardings . The initial response to the posters was good and the committee was inundated with offers of enlistment following Britain\u2019s declaration of war against Germany. Many thought the war was an opportunity for adventure with friends - but when it became clear victory was more than a matter of months away, enthusiasm dwindled. Recruitment posters quickly turned to emotional blackmail, playing on the conscience of working men who had yet to volunteer. Tragedy: Another poster with its focus on the Scarborough raid, this time showing a damaged home and a little girl left alone to care for a baby . Messages included \u2018Why aren\u2019t you in khaki? You\u2019ll be wanted. Enlist at once\u2019, \u2018Don\u2019t stand looking at this - go and help!\u2019 and \u2018Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?\u2019. Others targeted the wives and girlfriends of potential recruits, urging them to persuade their partners to join the army. One read: 'To the women of Britain. Some of your men folk are holding back on your account. Won\u2019t you prove your love for your Country by persuading them to go?' Target: Many posters, such as these two from 1915, targeted the wives and girlfriends of potential recruits, urging them to persuade their partners to join the army . Appeal: This 1915 poster (left) was also geared towards women, telling them their the safety of their children depended on men going out to fight, while another played on the insecurities of fathers who wanted to make their children proud . By the time conscription was made compulsory in March 1916 the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee had issued 164 posters, with some reproduced in different sizes and in Welsh. The collection, which is only missing eight posters, is being sold by Onslows Auctioneers in Blandford, Dorset. Auctioneer Patrick Bogue said: 'With an inevitability of war approaching and a shortfall in soldiers, Parliament authorised an increase in the army of half a million men in August 1914. 'As a result the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee was formed to boost the recruiting effort and part of the drive included creating posters which were put up in public places. Positive: The initial response to the posters was good and the committee was inundated with offers of enlistment following Britain\u00bfs declaration of war against Germany . 'Interestingly, the posters show how over time the methods and messages used to recruit men changed. 'Many of the early posters depended on patriotism. 'Early . recruits viewed the war as a great adventure which was not to be . missed, particularly as the general view was that it would all be over . by Christmas 1914. 'Initially . these methods of propaganda provided a steady stream of new recruits . but by November 1914 there was a marked decline in numbers. 'As . it became clear the war was not going to be over as quickly as first . thought, more sophisticated and sinister methods were employed. Output: By the time conscription was made compulsory in March 1916 the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee had issued 164 posters, with some reproduced in different sizes and in Welsh. This poster from 1916 (right), bearing the message 'Forward', was the last printed before forced enlistment was introduced . Collection: Patrick Bogue of Onslow Auctions with the collection of posters. They are expected to reach \u00a320,000 when they go up for auction on July 9 . 'The messages were much more direct and even targeted the wives and children of potential soldiers, such as the now famous \u2018Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?\u2019 'This collection is almost complete - it includes every poster issued by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee apart from about eight. 'A collection like this is incredibly rare and serves to remind us of the iconic images used to recruit soldiers for this historic war.' The posters will go on public display at Chalke Valley History Festival in Wiltshire from June 23 to 29 ahead of the auction on July 9. At the outbreak of war in 1914, many young men were quick to enlist into the Army - spurred on by a desire to serve their country, or simply to avoid unemployment. By the end of September 1914 more than 750,000 men had joined up - many of them as part of 'Pals battalions' from the same workplace, football team or friendship group. However, within a year of Great Britain's declaration of war in August 1914, it became obvious that the country would not be able to continue fighting with just voluntary recruits. Although the famous 'Your Country Needs You' poster helped encourage more than one million men to enlist by January 1915 this was not enough to cover the rising number of casualties and the government decided there was no choice but to bring in conscription - compulsory active service. The Military Service Act became law in March 1916 and imposed conscription on all single men aged between 18 and 41, other than the medically unfit, teachers, clergymen and certain industrial workers. Conscientious objectors who opposed fighting on moral ground were also spared the draft, as were those living in Ireland, and men called up could appeal against the call up at a local Military Service Tribunal. Married men were subject to conscription following the passing of a second Act in May 1916, and in 1918 a further law raised the age limit to 51. Conscripted men were not given a choice of which service, regiment or unit they joined. However, if they expressed a preference to join the Navy then it had first refusal on whether to take him. Throughout the war around 2.5 million men joined the Armed Forces through conscription, with 1.1 million of them joining during the first year. Source: www.parliament.uk .",

Regulator Ofqual plans to cull 14 GCSEs and 29 AS and A levels, while reforming other qualifications. Media studies, for example, is to be reformed in GCSEs, AS and A levels. Under the proposals, film studies will be revamped at GCSE and AS-level but scrapped at A-level. Pay attention! Dozens of exam qualifications in subjects such as film studies and home ec are to be axed . The GCSEs planned to be discontinued include expressive arts, electronics, catering, home economics, manufacturing, engineering, performing arts and humanities. The aim is to make qualifications in different subjects \u2018similar in their level of demand and assessment structure\u2019 and to cut out \u2018similar or overlapping\u2019 courses. Tougher GCSEs in English and maths are being introduced from September 2015, and in history, geography, the sciences and languages the following year. In 2016, reformed GCSEs will also be launched in subjects including art and design, music, drama and dance, computer science, PE and religious studies. Ofqual has published a consultation paper on new standards for all other subjects in the secondary curriculum. It plans to \u2018regulate in ways that are likely to affect the range of subjects available\u2019 in future and could lead to exam boards \u2018choosing not to continue with some existing subjects\u2019. Its report says: \u2018We plan to set out clear principles that we will use to determine, before core content is developed, if a subject is likely to lead to the development of the GCSE, AS and A-level qualifications we expect. \u2018If a subject does not meet these principles we will not allow it to be developed as a GCSE, AS or A-level subject.\u2019 Shake up: The GCSEs planned to be discontinued include expressive arts, electronics, catering, home economics, manufacturing, engineering, performing arts and humanities. The GCSEs planned to be discontinued include expressive arts, electronics, catering, home economics, manufacturing, engineering, performing arts and humanities. Home economics \u2013 a qualification awarded to 32,064 students in 2012 \u2013 and catering \u2013 awarded to 20,891 teenagers \u2013 are deemed too similar to the new design and technology GCSE in food technology. Performing arts at GCSE, which was awarded to 4,365 students in 2012, is seen as overlapping with new exams in dance and drama. At AS and A-level, courses set to be cut include environmental studies, which overlaps with new science courses, along with human biology, which is listed as similar to biology. A separate list shows 20 GCSE subjects that are being considered for reform including business studies, economics, geology, hospitality and law. There are also 27 AS-level subjects to be considered for reform, along with 26 A-levels. These include media studies, law, history of art, critical thinking and philosophy. Exam boards will be expected to draw up \u2018core content\u2019 for each, with input from teachers, employers and higher education. The reformed qualifications will need approval by Ofqual. Revamped qualifications will be first taught from 2017. The majority of unreformed AS and A-levels will go from 2016 and GCSEs from the following year. Ofqual\u2019s chief regulator, Glenys Stacey, said: \u2018We will expect exam boards to consider factors such as demand and merit before making a case to us that any subject they choose to develop can meet the standards we set.\u2019 Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said last night: \u2018There are a few areas where we do have concerns about proposals to discontinue popular qualifications, in particular film studies at A-level and home economics at GCSE. We will be picking this up with Ofqual.\u2019",

While discussing those trolls who make nasty, anonymous comments online, Paltrow called the effect of their insults \"dehumanizing.\" \"You come across (online comments) about yourself and about your friends, and it's a very dehumanizing thing,\" Paltrow said, according to the interview. \"It's almost like how, in war, you go through this bloody, dehumanizing thing, and then something is defined out of it. My hope is, as we get out of it, we'll reach the next level of conscience.\" That bit of introspection did not go over well. Cindy McCain, wife of Sen. John McCain -- a former prisoner of war -- tweeted, \"Gweneth Paltrow is a joke. Her life is like taking bullets for a soldier. What a joke! My 2 sons serving in the military should talk to her.\" She further tweeted, \"Perhaps Gweneth Paltrow should go out on patrol with some soldiers.

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\n(Wired) -- Facebook is primed to announce this week that it's amassed a half billion active friends, a milestone reinforcing its status as the king of social networks -- a company to be regarded with the seriousness and power (if not revenue) of Google, Apple, Yahoo and Microsoft. Five hundred million and rising also makes it clear to anyone not paying attention that Facebook is no fad, that it is a cultural force shaping our collective culture. Even if you have no desire to ever set up a profile, you can't ignore it and you are now oddly defined in the negative and left out of the zeitgeist. A service of that size won't disappear anytime soon, even if Facebook has hit its plateau in the U.S. But net users are fickle and the web's short history includes dozens of sites that were once high-flying that have either since died (Geocities), lost their luster (Yahoo) or faded into irrelevance (Friendster). So how could Facebook lose its place at the center of the web? 1. Open, distributed alternatives . A pack of college kids drunk on Free Software launched an open-source, federated alternative to Facebook called Diaspora. After collecting an astonishing $120K in donations, the group is knocking out code. Meanwhile, there's other cool stuff going on, including OneSocialWeb, the Appleseed Project and WebFinger. Get enough of these open protcols into decent shape and someone is likely to build them into an improbably powerful stack. Research the LAMP stack, if you don't get my drift. What might that look like? An elimination of the need for a centralized home and coordinator of social networking -- where your social profile lives wherever you want it to (as your e-mail does) and can interact with any other profile around the net, on your own terms. While it sounds far-fetched, a recent poll suggests that people are as happy with Facebook as they are with their cable company, even if they do find it similarly indispensable. 2. Google Me . There's rumors the search giant is hatching its own social network system, despite the fact that it's just not particularly good at social networking. Its Orkut social network has flailed and even seems to be losing its final two treasures, India and Brazil, to Facebook. Google's take on Twitter, called Buzz, isn't bad, but it's not been much of a hit -- despite some fine features such as threaded coversations. And then it's got Wave and Google Talk, and Google Chat and Google Profile and Google pages and Google Docs. I wonder if anyone has tried stacking any of those together over there in the Googleplex to create a place where people actually want to hang out -- the clear difference between a site like Facebook and a site like Google search. Interesting things happen when people hang out. 3. Location-based services and the mobile device . With the stunning popularity of pocket computers -- starting with the iPhone, location-centric services such as Foursquare are gaining users at the rate that Facebook used to. Perhaps most importantly, they are figuring out ways to use the addictive mechanics of gaming to create services even more engrossing than Facebook. To compete, Facebook has its own, very well-liked mobile app, and is set to expand how it interacts with the real world. But there's a real threat here that Facebook could get outflanked by clever kids not too much unlike themselves, who figure out how to create a more potent digital heroin. 4. The U.S. Postal Service . For those who love dark horses or the old and familiar, there's always a chance that the world suddenly tires of their Facebook wall or virtual farming and decide to get off the net's grid entirely. Socializing will still be necessary, of course, so we'll see the return of sockhops, neighborhood restaurants and church socials. As for written messages, the Postal Service is actually quite good at delivering hand-written correspondence anywhere in the States for a nominal fee. The photo postcard will be huge again. But since the Postal Service is proposing to cease Saturday delivery, its social networking service would be a weekday-only affair. Vive la Poste! 5. Overreaching on the part of Mark Zuckerberg . Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has changed the culture of the world with his single-minded devotedness to making people share more information with more people. In a world where software can determine culture, Zuckerberg's unwavering drive to make more and more of the details of our lives public by default has triumphed in nearly every instance over prevailing cultural norms -- with the glaring exception of the Beacon project. But as with all visionaries, there is always the danger that in his attempt to lead his flock to the land of milk and honey, there will come a moment where he steps too far ahead, and the flock abandons the frontier for the pasture, leaving him alone and howling in the wilderness.

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a middle school student:\n\nIt's astounding how fast the words of a 22-year-old woman, her life suddenly cut short, have spread across the Internet and into the hearts and minds of people all over the world. Marina Keegan, a budding writer, was once published by the New York Times and had a job lined up at the New Yorker. Also a playwright, she had a musical slated for a staging in August at the New York International Fringe Festival. She wrote a moving essay in the Yale Daily News to inspire her fellow seniors as they graduated last week. She died in a car crash a few days later. That column, in which she strives to remind her peers that \"we have so much time,\" has taken on a tragic, powerful resonance. Discussing the \"immense and indefinable potential energy\" many felt as freshmen, she wrote that it's important to remember \"we can still do anything. We can change our minds. We can start over. ... We're so young. We can't, we MUST not lose this sense of possibility because in the end, it's all we have.\" The loss of Keegan is heartbreaking for many reasons. One of them is that she surely would have been among the too few people in the world who chase their dreams and bring them to fruition. I know what it is to feel the \"sense of possibility\" she described. I felt it when I was at Yale in the '90s. Since then, I've lived by it. I've also had time to see what distinguishes those who chase dreams from those who give up. Two friends of mine, fellow Yalies who graduated in different years and don't know each other, told me that in the years after college, they felt \"betrayed\" by some friends who had wonderful plans for the future and swiftly gave up on them. People who didn't harness their creativity to carve new paths. People who became focused on making more and more money and little else, who never took chances, because they got too busy, more interested in wealth or stature than doing something amazing, or just forgot about those dreams. In each case, I asked my friend how that amounted to betrayal. And each gave me the same answer: The plans we had for the future weren't just plans or hopes. They were a pact. We would take the education and incredible opportunities we had been given and go out and fight for a better world in new ways. Separately, together. It's what Keegan touched on in her last line to her class: \"We're in this together, 2012. Let's make something happen to this world.\" As I've written before, the world needs more visionaries. From electricity to vaccines to Hubble, everything humanity has created that improves our lives exists because dreamers pursued their visions. It's not easy, and it can become harder as you grow up and have families dependent on you. Life exhausts and distracts you into shelving aspirations. Making them happen is hard work. But it's incomparably rewarding. There is every reason to believe that Keegan would have fought for hers. It's clear in her writing. Written from the perspective of a young woman at the dawn of her adult life, her words are a stunning bookend to something David Brooks wrote about in October in the New York Times: a collection of short autobiographies that members of the Yale class of 1942 wrote for their 50th reunion. People who \"passively let their lives happen to them\" lamented \"how boring they must seem,\" while others \"regret the risk not taken,\" Brooks wrote. \"The most exciting essays were written by the energetic, restless people, who took their lives off in new directions midcourse.\" Anyone with an unfulfilled dream would do well to keep that in mind -- and should read Keegan's column, because it applies to them as well. The essays by people who \"felt summoned to do one thing,\" Brooks added, \"ring with passion and conviction.\" That's about instincts, which are ultimately the key to chasing dreams and the biggest driver for those of us who don't give up. We let ourselves tune out everything else and listen to what our instincts are telling us we have to do. That's why nothing can stop us. It's easy to imagine that nothing would have stopped Keegan. Her death is also a reminder of a daily tragedy. While U.S. fatalities in car crashes are decreasing, far too many families and friends know the pain of such loss. Keegan, above all else, valued family and friends. In this, she seemed wise beyond her years. I was -- like many other ambitious young people -- so focused on career goals, it took me years to gain the perspective she had and live by the knowledge that the loved ones you surround yourself with are by far the most important thing in life. \"We don't have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we did, I could say that's what I want in life,\" she wrote. Yale graduates from 70 years before her say the same. \"For almost all, family and friends mattered most,\" Brooks wrote. Keegan's words give us all reason to remember the world of possibilities before us and to make sure we're valuing time with loved ones. In her death, she just may be inspiring people to live better, deeper, more exciting lives -- with \"passion and conviction.\" And that's unforgettable.",

Branson's company Virgin Galactic announced Monday that the VSS Enterprise had successfully completed what it called a captive carry flight attached to a carrier plane. The spacecraft's developer called it a \"momentous day.\" \"The captive carry flight signifies the start of what we believe will be extremely exciting and successful spaceship flight test program,\" said Burt Rutan, founder of Scaled Composites, which built the spacecraft. The VSS Enterprise remained attached to its carrier aircraft for the duration of the 2-hour, 54-minute flight, reaching an altitude of 45,000 feet, according to a statement from Virgin. Eventually, the 60-foot long rocket plane will be taken 60,000 feet above the Earth by its carrier and fire rockets to propel itself into space. The test-flight program is expected to continue through 2011, going first to a free glide and then to a powered flight before commercial flights begin. \"Seeing the finished spaceship in December was a major day for us but watching VSS Enterprise fly for the first time really brings home what beautiful, ground-breaking vehicles Burt and his team have developed for us,\" Branson said. \"Today was another major step along that road and a testament to U.S. engineering and innovation,\" he said. Virgin Galactic has envisioned one flight a week, with six tourists aboard. Each will pay $200,000 for the ride and train for at least three days before going. About 80,000 people have placed their names on the waiting list for seats. \"What we want to be able to do is bring space travel down to a price range where hundreds of thousands of people would be able to experience space, and they never dreamed that [they] could,\" Branson said last year. He has said he hopes the technology will lead to a new form of Earth travel, jetting people across oceans and continents faster through suborbital routes.",

The USB Type-C plug is reversible so users will no longer have to stab blindly at USB ports in order to connect and charge gadgets, because plugs will fit in sockets in either direction. The USB Promoter Group said that the next generation design is thinner than its predecessors so it can be used in increasing sleek smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks. The USB Promoter Group unveiled its USB Type-C plug which is reversible and slimmer than previous standards. Different types of ports are also pictured. The plug is designed for slimmer smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks but will not be compatible with older computer equipment without an adapter . The USB Type-C connector is a completely new design. It has been designed for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as tablets and ultrabooks. It claims to be robust enough for laptops and slim enough for smartphones. It is being built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies. The plug is smaller than current laptop connectors, and more closely resembles the size of the current 2.0 Micro USB. Crucially, it will be reversible meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in. This is similar to how Apple's Lightning connector works. \u2018The USB Type-C specification establishes a new cable and connector scheme tailored to fit mobile device product designs, yet robust enough for laptops and tablets,\u2019 the San Francisco-based group said. Reports of the fabled plug began in December last year and renderings of what it might look like leaked in April. The USB 2.0 specification was released in 2000 and became the standard by the end of 2001, followed by USB 3.0 in 2008, and 3.1 in July 2013. Apple uses its own Lightning Connector on newer models of iPhone and iPads, which can be inserted either way up. The Type-C connector will work in a similar way, while resembling the size of the current Micro USB plug. According to the group, the Type-C will be \u2018the only connector one will need across all devices.\u2019 In April, renderings were released shat showed a thinner USB dock, better suited for tablets and ultrabooks (illustrated). It is only now that the design and full specifications have been released . Crucially, however, because the new design is different to the current versions of USB plugs, users of older computing equipment will need an adapter to use the new plugs. \u2018Interest in the USB Type-C connector has not only been global, but cross-industry as well,\u2019 said Brad Saunders, USB 3.0 Promoter Group Chairman. \u2018Representatives from the PC, mobile, automotive and internet of things industries have been knocking down our door anticipating this new standard.' It is anticipated that everyday devices connected to the internet, from smart light bulbs to smart fridges will become increasingly common in years to come, as more consumers embrace the internet of things.

Quota call: European justice commissioner Viviane Reding . The EU will today unveil plans to force companies to put more women in their boardrooms. European justice commissioner Viviane Reding will announce the first step toward legal targets for the minimum number of females in top jobs. The attempt by Brussels to press for legal quotas on British businesses will prove highly controversial. But, speaking ahead of the publication of her report, Miss Reding warned equality would take another 40 years without radical action. She added that women were running out of patience at being kept from the top table. But Conservative MEP Marina Yannakoudakis condemned the quota as patronising and said women had to get top jobs on merit alone. 'In the UK 100 women were appointed to FTSE-100 and FTSE-250 boards last year and FTSE-100 boards currently have 15.2% female representation,' she said. 'I agree that there is still a long way to go, but these women were selected because they were the best people for the job. Had they made it to the top by virtue of quotas it would have been nothing short of patronising.' EU figures show that only 12 per cent of board members at large listed companies are women, well below the 40 per cent threshold targeted by Brussels. Miss Reding said: \u2018It\u2019s no secret that in countries where there are legal quotas [for representation on boards], the figures have grown substantially. \u2018In countries without obligatory quotas, progress is slow. I think we\u2019re slowly running out of patience everywhere in Europe. I am not a fanatic about quotas ... but I like the results quotas bring out.\u2019 The justice commissioner has previously called for voluntary targets of women making 30 per cent of board members by 2015, and 40 per cent by 2020. But her report is expected to reveal that progress has been slow in many EU countries. A public consultation will now seek views on the level, timing and scope of quotas, and sanctions for failing to meet them. Legislation proposed by Brussels requires the support of governments representing two thirds of the bloc\u2019s population. Last month, David Cameron refused to rule out the introduction of quotas if business leaders fail to meet Government demands for more females in top jobs. European Commission headquarters: The attempt by Brussels to press for legal quotas on British businesses will prove highly controversial . The Prime Minister said the promotion of women into senior jobs needed to be accelerated and that the case was overwhelming. However, ministers have been reluctant to enforce legally binding targets. Following a review by Lord Davies, the Government has instead set voluntary quotas for business leaders to more than double the number of women in boardrooms by 2015. Ministers have said that firms should employ a minimum 25 per cent of women executives. But Mr Cameron has said that this figure should be 30 per cent. Norman Lamb, Liberal Democrat coalition minister for employment relations, consumer and postal affairs, said: \u2018We think getting more women on corporate board is important. \u2018But for now, we do not support quotas, nor do we think it\u2019s appropriate for Europe to seek to impose them.\u2019 Business leaders have warned that compulsory quotas would backfire against women. City superwoman Helena Morrissey, chief executive of Newton Investment Management, last month warned that women would not feel equal in boardrooms if their bosses were forced to put them there. Women currently make up just 15 per cent of FTSE 100 directors. Mr Cameron has faced criticism for not appointing enough women. In the current cabinet, which has 23 members including the Prime Minister, there are just five women. Lord Davies last night warned that legal quotas would be a mistake and would \u2018raise the temperature\u2019. He told the Financial Times: \u2018The reality is that we have insufficient number of women of the executive committees of all British listed companies. \u2018That\u2019s something that will take a bit longer to fix, but I think you have to fix the board and then get the CEOs to realise that this is quite an issue.\u2019 Miss Reding, from Luxembourg, is the Brussels commissioner in charge of justice, fundamental rights and citizenship.",

Miracles do happen, and in the case of Gus Poyet, they can be made to look ridiculously easy. Exactly a month ago, after a 5-1 drubbing at Tottenham, a disconsolate Poyet surveyed his ailing side\u2019s prospects and declared it would take a miracle for them to preserve their Barclays Premier League status and avoid the drop. Four wins on the spin, a sequence more akin to a team with designs on the title, and, suddenly, the fate Sunderland\u2019s manager was resigned to has been averted with a game to spare. If that was wondrous enough, the way they have done it \u2014 not least a vibrant performance at the Stadium of Light last night that was capped by a goal of rare quality from Fabio Borini \u2014 has been even more astounding. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Gus Poyet talk about keeping Sunderland up . Job done: Fabio Borini scores Sunderland's second to keep them in the Premier League . Sunderland: Mannone 6, Vergini 6, O'Shea 6, Brown 6.5, Alonso 7, Larsson 7, Cattermole 7 (Giaccherini 88), Colback 7, Johnson 6 (Bridcutt 61), Wickham 6 (Altidore 61), Borini 7.5.

Manchester United, with an emphatic home win over Cardiff in between, . and now West Brom put to the sword. The result all but confirmed . Norwich\u2019s demotion to the Championship, but they can have no complaints. If they had a case . for staying up, which is debatable, it certainly could not be at the . expense of Poyet\u2019s revitalised side. It could be at West Bromwich\u2019s, but . only if they somehow manage to wipe out goal difference arrears of 17. Now that would be a miracle. There . was a touch of symmetry, too, about West Brom being on the receiving . end on the night Sunderland secured their Premier League future. They . were Paolo Di Canio\u2019s final opponents at the Hawthorns last September . before the axe fell on his stormy reign. A . jubilant Poyet joined his players in the centre circle at the end to . salute all sides of the ground, and the beaming smile was still in place . later, as he said: \u2018I believe in miracles now. I am absolutely . delighted and so proud. \u2018I . was brought in here to do one job, and that was keep us in the Barclays . Premier League. We have done that in a certain style, and it will be . remembered for ever. It is historic. People will talk about the season . Sunderland did it after being seven points adrift with six games left. Pick that one out: Borini fires home his goal . Kneesy does it: Borini celebrates his goal before half time . \u2018How . did the miracle happen?

That shows we have created . something special. We feel ready to take on anyone now, such is the . level of confidence in the team. Fight for the ball: Sunderland's USA striker Jozy Altidore is challenged by Graham Dorrans and Youssouf Mulumbu . Eyes on the prize: Colback vies with Victor Anichebe for the ball . \u2018This . is the biggest achievement of my life and the happiest I have ever . been. I think of the fans and the city, the staff and the chairman, and I . am just so pleased everyone can head home tonight knowing that they . will have Premier League football to look forward to next season.\u2019 Sunderland . went in front in the 13th minute, when Marcos Alonso went foraging down . the left and whipped in a low cross that Jack Colback\u2019s outstretched . boot sent spinning beyond Ben Foster\u2019s despairing right hand. Opening up: Jack Colback scores the first goal for Sunderland against West Brom . The great escape: Colback celebrates with John O'Shea after his goal . Sunderland have picked up the same number of points (12) from their last four games as they did from their previous 13 games. The . cushion of a 2-0 lead came courtesy of a goal that was brilliantly . worked and clinically executed. Borini played a ball inside to Sebastian . Larsson and kept advancing towards the area, as his team-mate . controlled it and weighed up his options. Decision . made, Larsson cleverly lifted the ball over West Brom\u2019s static . defenders and into the path of Borini, who by this time had reached the . penalty spot and faultlessly finished off a sublime move with a . first-time volley on the turn. West . Brom briefly rallied in the second half and almost reduced the arrears . when Victor Anichebe narrowly failed to convert Craig Dawson\u2019s cross as . he slid in at the far post.

UK police said 15-year-old Shamima Begum and two other London girls took a flight to Istanbul from London Gatwick Airport on Tuesday. Their families have reported them missing, and London's Metropolitan Police say the girls are believed to be heading to Syria, where militant groups and government forces are locked in a war, and parts of which have been taken over by the Islamist terror group ISIS. \"We miss you terribly and are extremely worried about you,\" Shamima's family said in a statement that Metropolitan Police released Saturday. \"Please, if you hear this message, get in touch and let us know you are safe.

But somehow, James May got left behind. Undaunted, the 20-year-old soldier stole a car and managed to evade the Germans, eventually finding a skipper six days later to sail him home. Four years on, he was back - storming the beaches of Normandy as part of Operation Neptune - and lived to tell the tale. Now aged 93, he has finally been awarded his campaign medals - almost 68 years after peace was declared. Reluctant hero: James May, 93, pictured with his medals at home in Dunkeswell, Devon - he didn't collect the medals for 68 years, but says he is proud to have them now . Despite his . heroism, Mr May prefers not to dwell on his wartime experiences - and it . was not until a neighbour in his home town of Dunkeswell in Devon asked . to see his war medals that he felt the absence of them. As a young man . after the war ended, he had never bothered to claim them. After discovering this, the neighbour began the process of applying for them on Mr May's behalf. The six campaign medals due to him were the 1939-45 star, the War Medal, the Defence Medal, the France and . Germany star, the . Normandy Medal and the Dunkirk medal. Now that he has received them, Mr May said he is proud to have the reminder of his loyal service in - and lucky escape from - two such seminal historic events of the last century. 'I was just 20 years old in 1940 - I wasn't interested in medals but I'm proud now that I have got them,' he revealed.' Mr May said that he left London and joined the Royal Army Service Corps in 1940 as a driver with the British Expeditionary Force. He was stationed in France and was meant to evacuate with other Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbours of Dunkirk as part of 'Operation Dynamo', intended to rescue the British, French and Belgian soldiers who had been cut off by the encroaching German invaders. Honoured: Mr May's medals including the 1939-45 star,  the France and Germany star, the War Medal, the Defence Medal, the Normandy Medal and the Dunkirk medal . Brave troops: Vessels for the invasion of Normandy, seen from deck of the HMS Warspite . But while nearly 340,000 troops were rescued by a band of 850 ships - many of which were privately owned and included motor yachts and fishing boats - May was not one of them. Left behind, the soldier went on the run across Nazi-occupied France in a stolen car with six of his army comrades. Six days later the group found a . skipper who agreed to sail them back home. On the way they were still under threat, and were shadowed . by a German U-boat before they finally came ashore on the English . coast. After two years . serving in Northern Ireland, he returned to France for the Normandy landings in . June 1944 - also known as Operation Neptune, the invasion began on D-Day, 6 June 1944, and ended on 30 June 1944. The landings were undertaken in two . phases - an airborne assault landing of 24,000 troops shortly after . midnight, and an amphibious infantry landing on the coast of France . starting at 6.30am. In total, more than 160,000 soldiers attacked along a 50-mile stretch of coast. Normandy: The landings were undertaken in two phases, an airborne assault landing of 24,000 troops shortly after midnight, and an amphibious infantry landing on the coast of France starting at 6:30 am . The Allies swiftly established a firm foothold in Normandy, and Mr May was part of one of the great turning points for Allied fortunes in World War Two. His role was as a driver of one of the DUKW amphibious landing vehicle known as . 'ducks'. 'It was just luck I suppose, surviving . the war,' said Mr May. 'I was a duck driver on D-Day and when they fired the big gun . on the back the thing nearly went over.' He remained in the Army until 1946. After being demobbed Mr May began working in sales, married his wife Elsie, and retired to Devon with her more than 30 years ago. Stoic: 'He is part of that generation who are not likely to start jumping around the room over a shiny bit of metal, but I could see what it meant to him,' said Mr May's neighbour . Next-door-neighbour Jim Greenshields helped Mr May obtain his six campaign medals after a chat revealed that Mr May had nothing to show for his time in the Armed Forces. 'I used to chat to him about the war - he has been through quite a lot but doesn't really want to talk about it,' said Mr Greenshields, a flying instructor at Dunkeswell aerodrome. 'It is amazing that he was at D-day and Dunkirk - not many can say that, as I would imagine the odds of surviving both are pretty slim.' But Mr Greenshields said that his neighbour was not one for fuss, and preferred to be stalwart about the medals. 'He is part of that generation who are not likely to start jumping around the room over a shiny bit of metal, but I could see what it meant to him.' Hailed . by Winston Churchill as a 'miracle of deliverance', the evacuation of . Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk is one of the . best-known episodes of the Second World War. After . British, French and Belgian troops became cut off by the advancing . German army, some 850 ships sailed to France to rescue them. They . included the 'famous little ships of Dunkirk', a flotilla of about 700 . merchant marine boats, fishing boats, pleasure craft and lifeboats. Between May 27 and June 4, 1940, around 340,000 soldiers were rescued, including almost 200,000 British troops. The . mission, codenamed Operation Dynamo, incurred significant losses, . however, and Churchill warned afterwards: 'Wars are not won by . evacuations'. The . British premier said there was not doubt in his mind that the Allied . operations in Western Europe prior to the evacuation had been a . 'colossal military disaster'. Nine . Allied destroyers - six British and three French - were sunk during . Operation Dynamo, and more than 100 RAF aircraft were lost in the . fighting.",

It should be no surprise they tried to lure him to a poser\u2019s paradise where security is as high as the tax is low, and where the yachts are as big as the dogs are small. You can picture the hair gel glistening in the sun as his Ferrari glides by Casino Square. It is not so easy to envisage him performing to sparse crowds at the Stade Louis II, but maybe one day it will appeal. \u2018It\u2019s true we met Ronaldo,\u2019 nodded Vadim Vasilyev, Monaco\u2019s vice- president and right-hand man to billionaire owner and president, Dmitry Rybolovlev. \u2018I know Ronaldo, but it was not quite on. Monaco's days of signing A-list talent like Radamel Falcao (left) and James Rodriguez (centre) are over . Monaco have downgraded their transfer policy from signing Falcao to the likes of Dimitar Berbatov (right) Rodriguez left the principality to sign for Real Madrid for around \u00a360m in the summer . Monaco's vice president Vadim Vasilyev concedes a France FA bill and FFP regulations have cut spending . \u2018We were joking one day he might come. He likes Monaco, the project, and our president, they know each other. We sat down with Ronaldo but knowing we were looking a bit more in the distant future. We did not enter into serious discussions with Wayne Rooney, but we had contact about signing him. We were almost at the point of meeting Rio Ferdinand but he did not want to come.\u2019 These targets were set in the heady days after the Rybolovlev takeover saved AS Monaco from relegation to the French third tier and the threat of extinction in December 2011, and then restored them to Ligue 1 within 18 months. Since then, strategy has changed. A-list players are no longer such prime targets. Stars like Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez have left, but the ambition remains to keep this club at the top. The Ligue 1 club held talks with Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo during the height of their financial power . Wayne Rooney (left) and Rio Ferdinand were also courted by the formerly big spending French side . \u2018Monaco is an attractive place,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018Families and wives of players fall in love with it. For some, it\u2019s important to have a stadium full of 60,000 fans. For others, it is to have the feeling and security this country can offer. With equal terms, some players will say no, no, not Monaco, and others will say yes, yes, every time. This was the case with Falcao.\u2019 When Falcao moved on loan to Manchester United, soon after James had been sold to Real Madrid, fans protested and rumours were rife Rybolovlev was bored, feeling the pinch of his divorce or had fallen out with Prince Albert, after failing to acquire Monegasque citizenship. These were refuted by the owners, who put the policy shift down to UEFA\u2019s Financial Fair Play rules and a \u00a341.5million bill from the French FA to offset the club\u2019s tax-free status. \u2018To jump-start the project, massive investments were needed,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018Our president is a very ambitious man and we accomplished what we did. But since the summer 2013, I said: \u201cLook, there won\u2019t be massive investments.\u201d\u2019 Little known Silva Bernardo celebrates after scoring the winner in Monaco's 1-0 defeat of Nice at the weekend . Monaco's rise from the French third division to the Champions League has been bankrolled by billionaire owner\u00a0Dmitri Rybolovlev, pictured here with\u00a0Prince Albert II (right) The principality's lavish lifestyle, low taxes and high security are a lure for professional footballers . FFP rules squeezed this club, with its tiny fan base inside a nation with a population of 35,000. \u2018Nobody wants an unfair competition,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018The trick is how to implement this in real life. Is the recent (\u00a35billion) TV rights deal in England unfair to other European clubs? Can they compete at the same level when Premier League clubs can buy almost any player? \u2018Under these rules, a project like Chelsea or Manchester City is no longer possible. Is it good big clubs stay big and small ones stay small?\u2019 One arm of Monaco\u2019s new strategy is to revert to the strengths of the era when Arsene Wenger was in charge, producing talent like David Trezeguet, Lilian Thuram and Thierry Henry. Leonardo Jardim\u2019s squad is the youngest left in the Champions League, even with Ricardo Carvalho (36) and Dimitar Berbatov (34) boosting the average age to 23.9 years. Thierry Henry is one of several France legends to have been groomed at Monaco . Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has  the youngest squad left in the Champions League . \u2018When we signed Ricky (Carvalho) there was so much criticism because of his age,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018But when I met him for the first time, at night in Madrid, in his jeep so no one would see us, I recognised his positive personality and it has helped us a lot.\u2019 Another arm of the plan is to lean on Monaco\u2019s global appeal and association with its Royal Family and Grand Prix. The club crest has been redesigned to include the word Monaco rather than the initials ASM and this season\u2019s team photo was taken at the opulent Opera de Monte Carlo. \u2018Monaco is a historic club \u2014 one of the major clubs in France \u2014 and the ambition was always to give back this identity,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018We are unique. We consider ourselves part of the principality, which stands in this world for many things: luxury, sports, ecology.\u2019 Arsene Wenger will return to his former club when Arsenal face Monaco in the Champions League last 16 . The Gunners prepared for Wednesday's clash with a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace at the weekend . They are into the knock-out stages of the Champions League for the first time in a decade and the draw against Wenger\u2019s Arsenal laces the revival story with emotion. \u2018Wenger is revered as one of the great coaches in Monaco history and one of the iconic coaches in modern football,\u2019 said Vasilyev, but he quashed the idea the 65-year-old may return to the club he led to the French title in 1988. \u2018We have to accept Arsenal is a different level in European football. He has been there for nearly 20 years and done an amazing job. We have the greatest respect but to come back to Monaco is not on the agenda. We are going for coaches who still have to grow and prove themselves and develop as part of the project.\u2019 MAY 2011 .

Fined: Rebecca Gallanagh has been ordered to pay \u00a3140 for decorating her ankle tag . A fashion-conscious criminal who tried to 'bling' her electronic tag after being inspired by My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding has been fined \u00a3140. Rebecca Gallanagh used nail glue to spell out her name in fake diamonds on the ankle tag which was meant to ensure she kept her curfew. The 22-year-old has hit out at the justice system for wasting time on her case after she received the fine at Burton Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. Gallanagh was fitted with the . electronic monitor in November after being convicted of a public order . offence when she was involved in a fight outside a nightclub in her home . town of Tamworth, Staffordshire. She . was ordered to observe a strict curfew requiring her to stay at home . between 9pm and 7am for a period of three months, which forced her to . give up her job at a local bar. When . staff from Serco Home Affairs fitted the tag they told her she would be . allowed to decorate it however she wanted, she claims. 'The . lady who fitted the item said she saw a girl from My Big Fat Gypsy . Wedding who had blinged her tag, and she said I could do that,' Gallanagh said. 'I saw pictures of it online and checked the leaflet, and nowhere did it say I couldn't decorate it.' But . when she moved home in December and had to be fitted with a new tag, Serco workers . saw the decoration and reported her to the authorities. The company argued in court that Gallaghan had 'compromised the integrity' of the device with her diamant\u00e9 design. 'Bling': Gallanagh was inspired by My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding to add decoration to the monitor . Upset: Rebecca, pictured today without her tag, claimed the whole case was a waste of time and money . Magistrates agreed, telling the defendant she had committed a 'very serious offence' and slapping her with a \u00a355 fine, along with \u00a385 court costs and a \u00a320 victim support surcharge. Speaking after her court appearance, Gallaghan said the 'petty' case had gone too far. 'I wouldn't have wasted my time doing it if I knew I was going to be fined for it,' she said. 'It's a massive waste of time and money. There are all these people who go out and breach their orders, and all I've done is decorate my tag - that's just not right. 'I was actually proud of decorating the tag at the time. I wanted to make it look nice while I had it strapped to me around the house, it was a personal thing. Offence: Gallanagh was given the tag after being caught fighting outside a Tamworth nightclub, pictured . 'Serco say I damaged the tag, but I didn't - I didn't touch the sensor, it was still working and I was being monitored. She added: 'I did it to make me feel better about wearing it. I was quite proud of it. I like to bling things up, and wear blingy clothes and watches. It just matched my style.' Her mother April, 48, said: 'It's pathetic. Once her tag was replaced she didn't decorate it again as she had learned her lesson.' Gallaghan's lawyer Mark Moore said: 'This is a young girl who was coming up to Christmas - there were opportunities where she was out and about, and she was trying to make the tag look nice.' Prosecutors for Serco said that decorating the strap 'could affect the device', but confirmed that there had been no other breach of Rebecca's curfew order.",

Women are to be allowed to serve on submarines for the first time in the Royal Navy\u2019s history. Female officers can serve beneath the waves on Vanguard-class subs, which carry the Trident nuclear deterrent, from 2013, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced yesterday. Women of lower rank will follow two years later, when they will be able to serve on the new state-of-the-art \u00a31.2billion Astute-class \u2018hunter-killer\u2019 submarines. Female officers will begin serving on British submarines from 2013 . The announcement breaks more than 100 . years of tradition. Women had been barred from subs because of concerns . that carbon dioxide in the recycled air could damage their fertility. There were also concerns among top . brass that the presence of women could create disruptive relationships . on underwater missions that often last months. But Mr Hammond said he was scrapping . the long-standing ban on females on the recommendation of Admiral Sir . Mark Stanhope, the head of the Navy, after experts at the Institute of . Naval Medicine concluded that health fears were \u2018unfounded\u2019. Philip Hammond has announced that women can serve on submarines . Pregnant sailors, however, will still be banned from going to sea amid concerns that fumes could damage an unborn child. Addressing the Royal United Services . Institute think-tank, Mr Hammond said Britain\u2019s Armed Forces would . \u2018value our history and tradition \u2013 but we will not be slaves to them\u2019. The lifting of the ban ends one of the . last all-male bastions of the Armed Forces following pressure to . introduce equal opportunities throughout the military. Wrens have served on Royal Navy . surface ships since a ban was lifted two decades ago, and about 9 per . cent of personnel are now female. The Australian, Canadian, Danish, . Swedish and Norwegian navies already allow women to serve on their . submarines. And last year the U.S. axed the ban on female submariners. The new Astute attack submarines could easily be adapted so females have their own areas with showers and beds. New Astute class submarines will have women serving on them from 2015 . Philip Hammond has confirmed that the final estimate of the cost of military operations in Libya was \u00a3212million. The figure is less than the last estimate issued by the Ministry of Defence in October of \u00a3300million. The fall is primarily due to a drop in the estimated cost of replacing spent munitions from \u00a3140million to \u00a367million. Mr Hammond stressed there was no going back on the cuts in the Government's Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). 'The situation we face now - after the years of political failure to grip the problem - is that eliminating the black hole in the defence budget is the only way to sustain military capability over the long-term,' he said. 'Of course there are many valid and finely balanced arguments about the utility and necessity of individual capabilities. But let's be under no illusions - unpicking the SDSR piece by piece is simply not an option.'",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a middle school student:\n\n(CNN) -- In Masai culture, it is traditional to open a conversation with \"Casserian engeri,\" which means \"And how are the children?\" The prominent value that the Masai place on the well-being of their children has me thinking about the well-being of our own children here in America. We rejoice with those who crossed the stage to receive their high school diplomas last spring, and look forward to the accomplishments of those who start school soon. Indeed, our children are doing well. For the first time in our nation's history, 80% of young Americans graduated from high school on time, according to the 2014 Building a GradNation. This is a significant achievement for those young graduates and our country as a whole. At that rate of increase, we can and should push forward to the goal of 90% on-time high school graduation by 2020. Four successive presidents have set forth this goal, and at last we are on track. But this statistic tells only a piece of the story about the well-being of our children. It disregards too quickly the remaining 20% -- about 800,000 young people per year -- who don't graduate on time. What happens to them? Why are these young people not progressing, despite all of our best efforts? Who are they? And what must we do to help them stay on track and thrive as contributors to the economy of our country? Over the past year, America's Promise Alliance has been seeking those answers, right from the source. Our Center for Promise at Tufts University interviewed hundreds of young people who did not graduate on time or at all. And then we surveyed thousands of young people from all 50 states. So, how are our children? Their responses, compiled and analyzed in the report \"Don't Call Them Dropouts,\" are heartbreaking, humbling and ultimately hopeful. So many young people described the circumstances in which they grew up, environments made toxic by physical and emotional abuse, exposure to extreme violence, family stress and caretaking responsibilities. Young people have many reasons for leaving school, not all of them related to boredom or lack of motivation. Many leave because of complex and challenging life circumstances that, without proper adult support, make leaving school look like the only option. In the wake of leaving school without graduating, many showed tremendous optimism and a drive to achieve adult success. They want for themselves what we want for them: more education, a solid job, a strong family, a stable place to live. With this backdrop, it's no surprise that many of the people we interviewed took exception to the term \"dropout.\" They don't feel that they \"dropped out\" or, worse, quit. They simply made a decision to change the course of their lives. Nothing will be easy about increasing our national high school graduation rates. However, for the sake of our nation's future, we must not forget about the potential that exists in 20% of our nation's students. Yes, all students need high quality schools with strong teachers and strong curricula, but they also need environments where they are heard. Set preconceptions and assumptions aside, and just listen hard. Try to understand their experiences and perspective, however challenging. Show them, in some way, that you care about their future. For our young adults with the highest needs, more schools should incorporate an early warning system to identify students whose attendance, behavior and course performance suggest that they need extra support to stay in school. Communities should consider how to create similar early-warning supports and systems beyond the school building for young adults affected by risk factors like a death in the family, an incarcerated parent or housing instability. As good stewards of our communities, we must help provide the support that our young people need for success, and that means learning from one another. With proven and promising examples of success happening all across the country, in and out of the classroom, we must create more opportunities for school systems and communities to collaborate with one another. It's in that sharing, that great progress can be made. The question \"How are our children?\" is the right one to be asking. But, let's not be afraid of the challenging and complex answers that comes with it. At graduation season, and every day, let's celebrate our high achievers while giving equal care to those young people taking the less common road.",

Just one year ago we would never have imagined that a mainstream publishing company like HarperCollins would dream of releasing a guide to bondage bedroom play - or BDSM, as it is known to the initiated. BDSM is a catch-all abbreviation that brings together the predilections for bondage and discipline (B/D), dominance and submission (D/s), and sadomasochism or sadism and masochism. While it is a lifestyle choice enjoyed, sometimes to extremes, by people across the globe, it is fair to say that the current popularity of BDSM refers to a sort of 'BDSM lite' - a tamer, more approachable version of the sexual proclivity. And that is just what is portrayed in HarperCollins' new guide. The book, Fifty Ways To Play - which carries the subtitle BDSM for nice people. The publisher bills the book, by husband and wife duo Debra and Don Macleod as A Beginner's Guide To Unleashing Your Erotic Desires - and it is enough to have the more buttoned-up readers blushing into their blindfolds. Fifty Ways To Play claims to offer 50 'edgy and erotic' adventures which the publisher says are 'perfect for the millions of readers who have been inspired by the phenomenal Fifty Shades trilogy.' 'Fifty Shades has broken down the taboos about BDSM and more women than ever are wanting to spice up their sex lives,' HarperCollins said. 'But there is very little out there that shows you how to turn every night into an erotic fantasy. 'From turning your bedroom into a 'Red Room Of Desire [in the book it is known as the Red Room Of Pain] to exploring the fine art of Japanese rope bondage, these 50 edgy and erotic adventures make incredible sex incredibly easy,' they say. Conveniently for the budding BDSM-er, the book is being packaged up and sold as part of erotic gift sets by boxofgrey.com, a website set up for newcomers to the BDSM world. Fifty Ways To Play is being sold as part of luxury BDSM packages on website boxofgrey.com . They have created gift boxes with a selection of props to complement the book, with two different sets on offer to assist the BDSM virgins: the Play Box, which includes a blindfold, paddle, kegel balls and a rope kit, and the Summer Holiday box, which contains a holiday-friendly selection of products that the site says are discreet enough that they can be packed in hand luggage without arousing suspicions during security checks.",

'Indiscriminate rocket fire' from long range GRAD Missiles struck a market, two schools, homes and shops according to the regional police force. The rocket fire had come from rebel-held territory, the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe said this evening, as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Russia to stop supplying arms tot he separatists. 'Russian troops in eastern Ukraine are supporting these offensive operations with command and control systems, air defence systems with advanced surface-to-air missiles, unmanned aerial systems (drones), advanced multiple rocket launcher systems and electronic warfare systems,' he said. 'I strongly urge Russia to stop its military, political and financial support for the separatists, stop destabilising Ukraine and respect its international commitments.'

Senseless: Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk has condemned the bombing as a deliberate attack on peaceful citizens . Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko has cut his visit to Saudi Arabia short to call an emergency meeting of his military officials, to coordinate the government's response. The country's Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk has condemned the bombing as a 'deliberate attack on peaceful citizens' and laid the overall blame on Russia's doorstep. He said: 'The world needs to stop the Russian aggressor threatening Ukraine, Europe and global security. 'The problem is in the hero-town of Moscow, the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin.' A 76-year-old pensioner who witnessed the attacks, said they started in the early morning. Leonid Vasilenko, who lives in the eastern suburbs of Mariupol, said: 'The walls were shaking, the window frames were shaking, paint started to crumble off the house. 'I hid in the basement. What else can you do? I took the dog and the cat. In the basement you could hear the earth tremble.' Incinerated: Cars, buildings and homes in Mariupol (pictured) were destroyed in the shelling attack . Deceased: The two bodies pictured in this residential area in Mariupol are among 23 who lost their lives . Terrified: A 76-year-old pensioner who witnessed the attacks said he could 'hear the earth tremble' from the basement where he was hiding . Revenge: It is thought today's attack in Mariupol (pictured) was payback for the explosion which killed 13 people in the rebel-held eastern region of Donetsk on Thursday . A 76-year-old pensioner who witnessed the attacks, said they started in the early morning. Leonid Vasilenko, who lives in the eastern suburbs of Mariupol, said: 'The walls were shaking, the window frames were shaking, paint started to crumble off the house. 'I hid in the basement. What else can you do? I took the dog and the cat. In the basement you could hear the earth tremble.' Mariupol mayor Yuriy Khotlubei said: 'The area that came under attack was massive. 'The shelling was carried out by militants. This is very clearly Russian aggression that has caused terrible losses for the residents of the eastern part of our city.' Despite international calls for a ceasefire, the separatists' leader Alexander Zakharchenko has vowed to push on with a new offensive and expel Ukrainian troops from the eastern region entirely. It is thought today's attack was payback for the explosion which killed 13 people in the rebel-held eastern region of Donetsk on Thursday. He said the insurgents would take no further part in peace talks, adding:\u00a0'Today an offensive was launched on Mariupol. This will be the best possible monument to all our dead. 'Attempts to talk about a cease-fire will no longer be undertaken by our side.' At a defence meeting in Kiev, Ukraine's defence minister Stepan Poltorak said there had been a serious escalation in fighting on the front-lines in the last 24 hours. 'Starting from Luhansk region and ending in Mariupol, everywhere illegal armed groups together with Russian units are going on the offensive,' he said.

Destruction: The shelling by pro-Russian rebels killed 20 people in the city of Mariupol, Ukraine (pictured) No compromise: The deadly attack comes just one day after separatists rejected a peace deal brokered to hinder the fighting . 'Strategically important': The coastal city of Mariupol lies on the Azov sea, between Russia and the annexed Crimean Peninsula . The rebels' new multi-pronged offensive against the country's troops has seriously hindered recent attempts to mediate an end to the fighting. Government-controlled Mariupol occupies a strategically important position on the Sea of Azov, on a coastal route from the Russian border to Crimea, which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine last March. Fierce fighting since the peace deal was signed in Minsk in September has heightened fears the rebel forces would try to establish a land link between Russia and Crimea. They currently have positions around six miles from Mariupol's eastern outskirts. The agreement signed in the Belarusian capital tried to instigate a cease-fire and the removal all of heavy weapons from certain areas in eastern Ukraine. But it has been repeatedly violated by both sides - and heavy artillery and rocket barrages have increased the civilian death toll in the last few weeks. On Thursday, mortar shells rained down on rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine - killing 13 people at a bus stop. The separatists retaliated both swiftly and brutally by parading captured Ukrainian troops through the city as enraged residents kicked and shouted abuse at them. Surrounded: Rebel forces currently have positions six miles outside the city of Mariupol, which they bombed this morning . Cut off: Emergency workers inspected a damaged bridge on January 21, following an overnight blast which severed the railway link between Mariupol and Ukraine's west . And last weekend, battles intensified over Donetsk airport, which has been reduced to rubble after months of fighting. Rebels eventually took control of the terminal and fighting has continued on its fringes since. Last week, Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko claimed there were 9,000 Russian troops inside his country and called on Moscow to withdraw them - blaming it for an armed aggression. Moscow denies sending soldiers and weapons to east Ukraine, despite what the West deems 'irrefutable proof'. Zakharchenko, who claims rebel fighters were advancing in three directions in Donetsk, said:\u00a0'We will hit them until we reach the border of Donetsk region, and if I see the danger for Donetsk from any other city, I will destroy this threat there.' On Wednesday, foreign ministers from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany agreed to revive a division line between separatists and Ukraine's troops, but fighting has continued unabated. The tentative peace deal forged in Berlin  called on both Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed rebels to pull their heavy arms nine miles on either side of the division line - although there was no agreement reached on a withdrawal of troops. Retaliation: The attack in Mariupol comes just two days after a grenade explosion at a bus stop in the rebel-held area of Donetsk killed 13 people . Fury: The leader of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko (left) said:\u00a0'Attempts to talk about a cease-fire will no longer be undertaken by our side' Death: At least 13 people were killed, and many were injured, in the bus attack in Donetsk - just hours after peace talks in Berlin called for a cease fire . Offensive: Zakharchenko has said pro-Russian rebels (pictured) are advancing in three directions in Donetsk, in a bid to claim the city entirely . But rebel spokesman Eduard Basurin threw the agreement into doubt by saying the insurgents 'will no longer consider the Minsk agreement in the form it was signed'. Basurin's bold statement contradicted the official position of Russia, which has repeatedly pledged respect for the Minsk agreement, which also requested the withdrawal of foreign fighters and the monitoring of the Russian-Ukrainian border by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The UN human rights agency has estimated that 5,100 people have been killed as a result of the conflict since April last year.",

Passengers heard not one but two chilling announcements on a recent United Airlines flight from Des Moines to Denver, after their pilot suffered a heart attack at 30,000 feet. Quick-thinking nurse Linda Alweiss, from Camarillo, California, rushed to respond when crew asked over the loud speaker if any passengers had medical training. But as she was administering aid to the 'mumbling and incoherent' pilot, another, distinctly more terrifying plea was heard: 'Does anyone in the cabin have flight experience?' Thankfully, the co-pilot managed to safely land the plane at an airport in Omaha, but not before the unusual request thoroughly frightened all on board. Scroll down for video . Hero: Quick-thinking nurse Linda Alweiss, pictured left and right, rushed to respond when the pilot suffered a heart-attack mid-flight . The drama began about 20 minutes into the December 30 flight. Mrs Alweiss was flying home via Denver with her husband and 16-year-old daughter from a Christmas vacation. When the first announcement was made the registered nurse with decades of experience was first to respond. She said she found the pilot slumped over in the cockpit. 'He was sick and mumbling and was just incoherent,' she told KTLA. The pediatric intensive care nurse, who only recently re-certified her advanced cardiac life support accreditation, noticed his heart was beating irregularly and determined he'd probably suffered a blood clot or a heart-attack. Scary: Mrs Alweiss was flying home via Denver with her husband and 16-year-old daughter from a Christmas vacation when the two frightening announcements were made . Another nurse, Amy Sorenson, of Wyoming, also volunteered to assist and the pair, with the help of other passengers, pulled the captain out of the cockpit and into the galley so they had more room to work. The nurses set up a diagnostic defibrillator and administered an IV. After the co-pilot took control of the airplane, Mrs Alweiss said she turned to the woman and asked, 'You know how to land the plane, right?' And she said 'yes.' 'I felt immediately comfortable. That was just one thing I didn't have to think about, so I could focus more on what was going on with the patient,' Mrs Alweiss recounted to KTLA. But a second announcement was made, asking if there were any pilots in the cabin. 'That kind of changed the story a little bit,' Mrs Alweiss' husband, Alan, explained with a laugh. Room to work: Alweiss and another nurse, Amy Sorenson, pulled the captain out of the cockpit and into the galley, pictured, and after the flight landed safely he was met by paramedics, right, on the tarmac . The co-pilot managed to land the plane without trouble and paramedics were waiting to treat the pilot on the tarmac. 'United flight 1637, a Boeing 737 . operating between Des Moines and Denver Monday evening, landed safely in . Omaha after the captain became ill,' the airline said in a statement. 'United accommodated the customers overnight, and they continued to Denver the next day.' On the rescheduled flight the following day, Mrs Alweiss sat next to the co-pilot who informed her the pilot had survived and was being treated in the cardiac unit of an Omaha hospital. 'She did her job,' Mr Alweiss proudly told KTLV of his wife. 'She jumped at the opportunity, didn't hesitate. And she did it at 30,000 feet, knowing that the person who was supposed to be flying the plane was her patient.'",

The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to stop the shock devices used by the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton. Self-injury is one of the most difficult behaviors associated with autism and other developmental or intellectual disabilities. Some of the patients at the private facility outside Boston cut themselves while others slam their heads against walls or desks - one girl did it so hard she detached both retinas while another patient pulled out all his teeth. Scroll down for video . Electrical skin shocks used by a Massachusetts school to treat autistic patients who are self-harming may soon be banned in a Massachusetts school. Pictured: A therapist checks the ankle strap of a shocking device on student Andrew Goldberg  at the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton . Andrew, who was born with a developmental disorder, wears the device to control violent episodes . The facility, which takes on some of the hardest-to-treat cases, is the only place in the country known to use skin shocks as aversive conditioning for aggressive patients. The review is a rare move by the FDA, following years of complaints from disability rights' groups and even a U.N. report that the shocks are tantamount to torture. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg says the shock therapy has raised a lot of questions. With the remote control of a shock device hanging from his belt, a therapist watches as a physical education teacher helps student Andrew Goldberg (pictured) on a treadmill during an exercise program . Louisa Goldberg of Newton, Massachusetts, says the skin shocks are the only treatment that has worked for her son, Andrew, (both pictured) \u00a0who suffered brain damage at birth and became dangerously aggressive as he got older . Rotenberg must get a court's approval to begin administering skin shocks to a student . 'We really wanted to take a much more focused and rigorous look at it,' Hamburg said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'There's a lot of concern about the downside of this approach and the harm and the risk to the patients receiving it.' Rotenberg must get a court's approval to begin administering skin shocks to a student. The center uses a graduated electronic decelerator, or GED, that is attached to the arms or legs. Aversion therapy is a controversial form of therapy which is based on the premise that certain types of behaviour can be avoided if those displaying it associate it with an unpleasant feeling. This form of encouraging 'learnt behaviour', as made famous in the Anthony Burgess novel A Clockwork Orange, has received much criticism over the years. Questions have been raised over how effective the treatment is over the long-term while others have raised serious ethical concerns. According to SimplyPsychology, it is unclear why the shocks have certain effects, while the treatment is also believed to be less effective in the outside world away from the therapist. It is also said to have a high relapse rate. If the student acts aggressively \u2014 head-banging, throwing furniture, attacking someone \u2014 then a center worker can press a button to activate the electrode, delivering a two-second shock to the skin. Some patients compared the shocks to a hard pinch or bee sting. Others say it's far more painful; one said it was like being stung by a thousand bees. At an FDA advisory committee hearing this year, most of the neurology and ethics experts concluded the device poses an unreasonable and substantial risk, while acknowledging that other therapies don't work for everyone. 'I think that what has happened is that this has gone on for this long because this is a population who cannot adequately speak for themselves,' Dr. Karen Weigle, a clinical psychologist affiliated with the University of New Hampshire's Institute on Disability, told fellow committee members. Dr. Steven Miles, a bioethicist at the University of Minnesota, was one of several advisers concerned about the lack of scientific studies showing the shock therapy works. That only one treatment facility uses them, he said, makes it 'unreasonable to conclude that these devices are part of the standard of care for this class of patients.' But Louisa Goldberg of Newton, Massachusetts, says the skin shocks are the only treatment that has worked for her son, Andrew, who suffered brain damage at birth and became dangerously aggressive as he got older. Andrew Goldberg spent years at a New Hampshire facility, where his mother says he bit, hit and kicked staff members. When restraints did not work, workers tried medications to calm him. 'He was a zombie,' Louisa Goldberg said. Therapist Thomas Dohle comforts a student, who is wearing a waist pack holding a shocking device. Many students at the school, who were born with Autism and development disorders, wear shocking devices to control violent outbreaks . A female  student, wearing a shocking device on her leg, lines up with classmates after lunch . He was kicked out at age 19 and taken to Rotenberg, which weaned him from some medications and began the skin shocks. Now, at 33, Goldberg still gets a shock or two every month, but his mom says his life is better. 'Andrew is awake. He's alert. He's happy and he's functioning to the best of his abilities,' Louisa Goldberg said in an interview. 'We have our son back.' Rotenberg's executive director, Glenda Crookes, calls the shocks a last resort coupled with positive behavior programs, such as rewarding students with time at JRC's Internet cafe or the teen lounge with its arcade games. The idea is that the two-second shock is quick but painful enough to jar the patient out of the harmful episode. Of the 235 patients at the center, 55 are being treated with skin shocks. Most are in their 30s; five are between age 17 and 21. The FDA first cleared the GED device for use in 1994. But Rotenberg started using a more powerful version, about 2.5 times stronger, that was developed after one student built up a tolerance to the shocks. In 2000, the FDA said the newer device didn't need approval, but the agency changed its position in 2011 and said approval was required, eventually leading to April's hearing on whether to ban it altogether. Cheryl McCollins sued the center for malpractice after her autistic son, Andre, was shocked more than 30 times over approximately seven hours in 2002. A video shows Andre strapped face down and shocked because he would not remove his coat . Andre recovering after being shocked extensively - in the video he can be heard screaming, 'Help me. No' 'It's not safe. It doesn't feel safe. I ended up having nightmares,' Jennifer Msumba, 38, (pictured) testified via video at the FDA's hearing. She said the GED left burn marks and was prone to misfires, unintended shocks . The center insists it is safe, but some former students say otherwise. 'It's not safe. It doesn't feel safe. I ended up having nightmares,' Jennifer Msumba testified via video at the FDA's hearing. The 38-year-old said the GED left burn marks and was prone to misfires, unintended shocks. Msumba's mother is suing JRC. Her attorney says Jennifer Msumba, who has autism, was given more than 230 electrical shock treatments since 2002 and not permitted to take psychiatric medications. Msumba said she is less anxious at a new treatment facility in Florida. 'They help figure out what makes me want to do things that could be harmful so I can learn how I feel before it happens,' Msumba told the AP. Rotenberg representatives says the suit has no merit and that 'Jennifer made incredible progress' at the center. About 10 percent of people with intellectual disabilities or autism display self-injurious behavior. Severity varies widely and treatment should be individualized, said Dr. Louis Hagopian, program director of the neurobehavioral unit at Baltimore's Kennedy Krieger Institute. Hagopian was not part of the FDA panel reviewing skin shocks. The most studied approach - behavioral treatment - involves identifying what social or environmental factors trigger a patient's behavior, and then teaching the person coping skills plus altering their environment to decrease those problematic situations. Hagopian said medications that address mood, impulsiveness and other conditions also frequently are used. Jennifer Msumba's suit is not the first. Cheryl McCollins sued the center for malpractice after her autistic son, Andre, was shocked more than 30 times over approximately seven hours in 2002. In a surveillance video played in court, Andre is seen lying face down with his arms and legs tied to a restraining board. He can be heard screaming, 'Help me. No.' The center settled the suit. The center says that 'is not the same treatment approach JRC would take today.' Crookes, the center's executive director, said skin shocks would be suspended earlier and the center would take a closer look at potential triggers of aggression. Sharon Wood of Charlottesville, Virginia, fears a ban on skin shocks would return her 21-year-old son, Joshua, to the violent behavior that used to force her to lock herself in a room with her young daughter. Joshua Wood is profoundly autistic. His parents say they tried everything but the only thing that worked was the shocks. 'Do not take away what is saving his life,' Sharon Wood said in an interview as the FDA considers the ban. 'Don't take this away until you are convinced there are better alternatives.'",

They were. The two had dated briefly in the 1980s. But Boatwright doesn't remember any of that. The 61-year-old Florida-born U.S. Navy vet woke up in a California hospital earlier this year speaking only Swedish. He had lived in Sweden off and on for about 20 years. Now, here he was at Goteborg Landvetter Airport, where that old friend, Ewa Espling, plans to help him get himself together in her country. \"I just want to be able to live a normal life and hopefully get my memory back,\" Boatwright said Tuesday. Boatwright has been diagnosed with dissociative amnesia, a rare psychiatric condition typically associated with a traumatic event. He says he has no memory of his past. Police found him unconscious in a Southern California Motel 6 in February. Navy vet wakes up, speaks only Swedish . Tuesday, Boatwright recalled that, waking up in the hospital this year, he looked at himself in the mirror and started crying. He didn't recognize the face looking back. When doctors tried to talk to him, he thought that his name was Johan Ek and that he was from Sweden. He didn't know why he had five tennis rackets in his hotel room. He was treated at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs. The hospital discharged him to Roy's Desert Resource Center, where he has spent the past two weeks. The Riverside County Department of Mental Health bought him a one-way ticket to Gothenburg after Boatwright made it clear that he wants to live in Sweden. Boatwright said Tuesday that he is grateful for all of the help he has received. In the United States, Boatwright said, he felt like a stranger in his own country because he didn't speak the language: English. In Sweden, he feels safe and more calm and believes he'll be able to start rebuilding his life. \"I think it's the best solution for Michael, because he can't speak English,\" Espling said. \"To recover fully, I think he needs to come where he's safe and understands what's happening around him.\" Before Tuesday, Espling and Boatwright hadn't seen each other since 1984. Espling has arranged for a place for Boatwright to live in Sweden. She said she will try to assist as much as she can while he works through rebuilding his life. \"He's going to have a home as long as he needs it,\" she said. She identified Boatwright in a Swedish newspaper article this year. \"Michael asked me, 'Why are you doing this for me?' Because I know Michael would have done the same thing for me. If he had found me in the papers. This is a very nice man with a very big heart,\" Espling said. In an exclusive CNN interview this month, Boatwright said he suffers from recurring nightmares too disturbing to describe. Boatwright said he is pleased to be in Sweden and wants to start working once he gets his memory back. He hopes to become a tennis instructor because, in his view, it's the one thing he's good at. Boatwright compared his life to an empty chalkboard. \"After death, this is probably the worst thing you could ever go through,\" he said. Small pieces are starting to come back, however. Recently, a Swedish song called \"Sol, vind och vatten\" (\"Sun, Wind and Water\") popped into his head as if it were on repeat all day long. He had no idea where it came from. He doesn't recall any experiences that he and Espling shared in the 1980s, but some emotional remnants of the past remain. Asked how he feels about Espling, he said, \"I feel warm on the inside.\" Car crash leaves Australian woman with French accent . CNN's Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report.",

British Gas revealed today it made \u00a323 every second from its customers in the first six months of 2013 and hinted at more price rises. After raising its prices just before last year's record-breaking cold winter, the energy giant raked in a \u00a3356million profit from households during the first half of this year - up 3.2 per cent on 2012. As people cranked up the heating to deal with plunging temperatures, residential gas consumption alone soared by 18 per cent during the first four months of 2013. The news has led to consumer groups demanding they freeze the price of gas and electricity to ensure households can afford to keep warm this winter. Parent company Centrica also enjoyed bumper profits of \u00a31.58billion for the past six months - up nine per cent - causing its shares to rise sharply this morning. Profits hike: British Gas's residential arm made \u00a3356million in the first half of this year, up 3.2 per cent . Facts: A huge rise in revenue from households driven by a price increase and freezing conditions helped British Gas increase residential profits to \u00a3356million . Its profits would have been higher but were held back by a new duty to pay for energy efficiency measures in customers' homes, which helped push environmental costs up 37 per cent for the period. Centrica warned that the scheme, which has landed it with a \u00a31.4 billion bill, would 'inevitably impact on customer bills ultimately' and that it was facing 'upward pressure on costs'. Finance director Nick Luff said: 'We will keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can. If prices do have to go up, we will delay it for as long as possible.' Today consumer group uSwitch said British Gas should not raise its prices again this year. 'The . fact that British Gas has absorbed increasing costs so far this year . will be of cold comfort to consumers who may be fearing the worst \u2013 . especially with rumours of price rises. Profits are up from last year, . so we would urge British Gas to help quell customer's fears and go one . step further from its May pledge and commit to a price freeze for the . rest of the year,' spokesman Tom Lyon said. 'People are already starting to worry . about next winter and the cost of their energy bills and high energy . prices have a big impact on consumers. Last winter, almost seven in ten . households went without heating at some point to keep their energy costs . down.' But Centrica maintain they are giving consumers a good deal. Chief executive Sam Laidlaw said: . 'With our customers using more gas to stay warm during the unusually . cold winter, we're doing everything we can to help them keep their . energy costs under control and make bills simpler and clearer.' Cashflow increase: A drop in average temperatures in Britain helped British Gas increase its profits . Today's announcement of its half-year . financial results are likely to spark anger as it is revealed how . British Gas boosted its bottom line via the steep bills landing on . customers' doorsteps in the wake of the freeze. The earnings announcement comes a day after French-owned energy firm EDF said its profits had risen to a record \u00a3903million in the wake of the cold spell. British Gas's rise in profits does not entirely reflect gains from heavy winter gas usage, which are likely to have been offset by the cost of a new obligation to deliver energy efficiency measures in customers' homes, analysts said. Boss: Centrica's chief executive Sam Laidlaw pledged to 'keep energy costs under control' The company has been the subject of sustained hostility as it awarded multimillion-pound pay packets to executives while customers have struggled to pay rising energy bills amid the economic downturn. Its results announcement also comes as new rules on simpler energy tariffs provoke an industry backlash.

Dale Brown, who coached him while at Louisiana State University, sat by O'Neal's side. The announcement was an upbeat occasion, with the athlete thanking his parents for stressing the importance of education, especially if he were to endure a career-ending injury. O'Neal is completing his doctorate in human resource development at Barry University in Miami. O'Neal first said Wednesday afternoon that he was going to hang up his jersey. The 39-year-old posted a link to a video on his Twitter account. In a brief message he said: \"We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon.\" O'Neal has been dogged by injuries in the latter stages of his career and played only 37 games for the Boston Celtics this season after struggling with an Achilles tendon problem. He told reporters he did not want the Celtics to have to wait to see whether he fully rebounded from surgery. The superstar returned for two playoff games against the Miami Heat but managed just 12 minutes, and he told an ESPN reporter that he didn't want to let Celtics fans down. O'Neal won three titles with the Los Angeles Lakers after forming a devastating partnership with Kobe Bryant, and added a fourth in 2006 with the Miami Heat. With 28,596 points, O'Neal is fifth on the all-time NBA scoring list and is second only to Michael Jordan on the all-time list of NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Awards. \"I'm really going to miss the free throws,\" he quipped Friday. He began his career in 1992 when the Orlando Magic picked him first in the NBA Draft and quickly won rookie of the year honors. O'Neal took the NBA scoring title in 1995 as he led the Magic to the NBA finals, but they were beaten by Houston. He won the accolade again in 2000, when the Lakers won the finals.",

Rihanna apparently revealed the release date for her new album over Twitter. The Barbadian songstress arrived a bit late to the Twitter party when she -- or her people -- created a \"rihanna\" tag yesterday and sent out a single, sparse tweet: \"The Wait Is Ova. Nov. 23 09.\" Whether that's the name of a new single, the beginning of a viral marketing campaign -- or both -- is unknown, but a representative for Rihanna told Entertainment Weekly that though the date \"looks accurate\" for her album release, \"The Wait Is Ova\" is not the album title. The only other object fans can mine for clues about the singer's upcoming release is the logo, a metallic nail fashioned into a crudely shaped \"R\" that has swarmed the Internet. The new record would be her fourth since her debut at 17. In the four years since, she's evolved from an unknown, breezy pop singer to a sonically and fashionably more distinct persona. One can only expect that her latest effort would continue to show that growth. Yet there are extra layers of anticipation surrounding the unnamed work: Not only is this Rihanna's follow-up to \"Good Girl Gone Bad,\" the album that made her an international superstar, it's also the first time she is piping up as a solo artist since the infamous fight with her ex-boyfriend, Chris Brown, in February. Those who've worked with the star on the record have said to expect something with more ferocity. \"Expect an edgier, almost angrier Rihanna on this one,\" Ne-Yo told E! Online. \"Rihanna says some things on this album that you've never heard her say before.\" But, said Mariel Concepcion, associate editor for Billboard.com, that statement shouldn't be taken too literally. \"She has changed a bit, but I think she's simply grown. Fans are expecting her to reveal some details, but I think she's going to subliminally let it be known that 'Yes, [Chris] hurt me, but I'm moving forward with life.' This issue was such a serious issue, it calls for more than putting out an angry song about it.\" Tracey Johnson, who said she's been a fan of the singer since the beginning, has high expectations for the upcoming release, but not because she expects to hear about Rihanna's personal life. \"[Some fans] feel like it would be good for her to represent abused women in some sort of way and say something, but in my perspective, she doesn't owe us anything,\" Johnson said. \"She's always been pretty private about the relationship, and she's never opened a lot in her music anyway.\" If Rihanna maintains her silence, Johnson said, it will be \"kind of a hit back at the critics who said she disappeared after not becoming the spokesperson for domestic abuse. She's saying this is what you should be paying attention to: I'm a fashion icon, and I make great music.\" Johnson, co-founder and editor of celebrity Web site NeonLimelight.com, has paid close attention to Rihanna's reported studio time over the past few months, but said he didn't expect to see the album appear so soon -- and with a tweet, no less. \"I'm definitely expecting more for this album,\" she said. \"Rihanna has a platform now that she didn't have before 'Good Girl Gone Bad.' She's gone a step forward with each album, and I think it's going to be a little more of what we heard on 'Good Girl Gone Bad,' but to the next level.\" That's a prediction that Concepcion agrees with, considering that the people who have been pulled in on this album resemble the team who worked on \"Good Girl\": Justin Timberlake, Ne-Yo and Tricky Stewart, who was behind the single \"Umbrella\" that launched Rihanna to a new level of pop stardom. Devin Lazerine, editor of Rap-Up.com, said Stewart isn't trying to top the success of \"Umbrella,\" but rather create a sound that would live up to its success. \"Just from hearing 'Run This Town' we can see the direction she's heading in,\" Lazerine said. \"It's going to be darker and more edgy. She was actually going to put that song on this album, and then Jay-Z heard it and they traded songs.\" Still, Lazerine said, \"dark\" and \"edgy\" don't always equal \"personal.\" \"She's all about the music and the sound -- I think we're going to get something that embodies her fashion sense,\" he said. \"I don't think there's going to be much about the Chris Brown situation; I don't even think her fans expect that. They just want something that pushes the boundaries.\" Rihanna's former other half, Chris Brown, has been busying in the studio as well. The singer, who was sentenced to five years' probation and more than 1,400 hours of community service in August, released the single \"I Can Transform Ya\" with Swizz Beatz and Lil Wayne a few weeks ago, but it's not the only one circulating the Internet. \"So Cold,\" a ballad with lyrics that sound suspiciously autobiographical, was leaked onto the Internet yesterday, as Brown's Twitter page confirms. Nonetheless, the artist does plan to keep it on the upcoming album \"Graffiti,\" which has an undetermined release date.",

Elegant yet cozy, substantial yet relaxed, the space brims with creative spirit. Credit can be given to any number of factors, from the artfully layered furnishings to the welcoming personality of Burch herself. But she is quick to give due recognition. \"I work with a feng shui master,\" she says, seated in an armchair that is positioned, according to said consultant, to yield a particularly auspicious flow of harmonious life forces. Good vibrations have always been central to the Tory Burch brand, whose twist on preppy style makes cheerful use of classic hues and graphic patterns. In the ten years since the label's launch, it has expanded from a single Manhattan boutique into a global empire, with more than 120 outposts\u2014a Milan flagship is next\u2014and collections of clothing, cosmetics, home accessories, and more. This October the company will debut a line of watches as well as release its first book, Tory Burch: In Color (Abrams). Reflecting on this rapid growth, Burch remarks, \"I could never have imagined.\" Architectural Digest: Bette Midler's Jaw-Dropping NYC Penthouse . Another constant throughout the brand's history has been Daniel Romualdez, the AD100 architect and designer responsible for the stores' famously ebullient decor. When Burch relocated the firm to its current headquarters, in the city's Flatiron neighborhood, she immediately called upon Romualdez to collaborate on her own suite (comprising an office and waiting area) as well as the company's reception spaces. \"Daniel makes the process so much fun,\" she says. The feeling is decidedly mutual. According to Romualdez, who helped decorate Burch's Manhattan and Hamptons homes, too, \"Tory is a dream. She knows exactly what she wants, but she also lets you run with an idea.\" Architectural Digest: Elton John's Beverly Hills Home . In the case of Burch's new work space, what she desired was a setting that stayed true to her brand's retail concepts while adapting its signature look into something personal, almost residential. Certain details are direct references to the boutiques. The oak wall paneling, for instance, is based on woodwork used at the label's Madison Avenue location, while the X-base stools and Louis XVI--style side chairs are variations on those installed at many of the outposts. For the most part, however, the array skews toward unique pieces, with family photos and pedigreed furnishings alongside treasured keepsakes from her travels. Particularly fine are the matching bookshelf and desk\u20141960s designs by Howard Dilday for Count Rodolfo Crespi's bedroom at Palazzo Odescalchi in Rome. Burch admired the set and snatched it up from antiques dealer Gerald Bland. Architectural Digest: Incredibly Designed Vineyards . \"With Tory, it's about honoring her taste at that moment,\" Romualdez says. \"Her aesthetic is always evolving.\" But some elements stay the same. The combination of blue and white is a leitmotif, appearing here in various configurations, from an antique mirror framed in crystal and cobalt-blue glass to the wall-mounted collection of china. \"Porcelain has always been a passion,\" Burch says. \"I was raised around it.\" Architectural Digest: Gorgeous Childrens' Rooms . Across the room, another soup\u00e7on of Burch's childhood has been given pride of place. Displayed on a brass-and-rattan side table is a vintage edition of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's novella The Little Prince. \"It's been a favorite book of mine since I was little,\" she says, adding, \"there are also such relevant themes for adults\u2014how you treat people, how you shape your outlook on life.\" They are lessons Burch applies at her company, making social responsibility part of its mission. In 2009 she established a foundation dedicated to the empowerment of female entrepreneurs, offering mentoring programs, business education, and access to low-cost capital. As the Tory Burch brand continues to advance, its founder's office is graciously equipped to meet all challenges. \"We have so many meetings here, everything from finance to fittings,\" she notes. \"People come in and out all day. This is the hub.\" Reprinted with permission of Conde Nast.",

But archaeologists have found that our ancestors likely ate these small carnivores during famines or food shortages. The finding of bones with human teeth marks dating back 3,100 to 7,200 years ago suggests the diet of Europeans once included these animals. The discovery was made at the El Mirador cave (shown) in Atapuerca, Spain. Archaeologists found bones with human teeth marks in them. The animals in the 'diet' included dogs, wild cats, foxes and badgers. Lead researcher Dr Patricia Martin said they may have been eaten during times of famine and food shortage . The discovery was made at the El Mirador cave in Atapuerca, Spain by archaeologists from the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution (IPHES). In July 2014 an expert claimed that eating dogs shouldn\u2019t necessarily be discouraged, and in fact adding the domesticated pets to our menus could be beneficial. In an opinion piece for CNN John Sutter said eating dogs is the equivalent of eating pigs, another intelligent creature. He cited figures from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) that said 1.2 million dogs are euthanised every year in the US. And he suggested eating them could be helpful in disposing of euthanised dogs. The remains of certain animals recovered from Neolithic and Bronze Age times suggest they were eaten by humans. In total 24 fossils were found indicating dogs and other animals were eaten. El Mirador was used to shelter flocks such as cattle, which were often eaten by the cave dwellers. But it appears small carnivores were also eaten, based on cut marks, bone breakage and signs of culinary processing found in the page. \u2018In El Mirador Cave, the dogs were disarticulated, defleshed and boiled,\u2019 said Dr Patricia Martin of IPHES, who led the findings. She said it was a possibility that humans only resorted to such meals during times of famine and food shortage. Shown is one of the bones recovered, from a dog, with noticeable human teeth marks on them, suggesting that Europeans once ate such small carnivores . El Mirador cave in Spain, shown, was used to store certain animals such as cattle, which were often eaten alongside the other carnivores. In total 24 fossils were found indicating dogs and other animals were eaten . However, she added that in some cultures such as in Asia, \u2018it is considered dog meat as a rich source of protein and/or as a delicatessen meat.\u2019 Therefore, she said: \u2018It cannot be excluded that in some cases the objective was to obtain the skin of these animals.\u2019 It\u2019s also possible that some of the other animals, like wild cats and badgers, were boiled and consumed by accident given the difficulty of hunting wild carnivores. \u2018However, neither it's possible to reject the option of being used as an extra source of food in times of shortage,\u2019 said Dr Martin.

A mother-of-three drowned after she was dragged out to sea away from her husband's grasp as he tried to save her in the Canary Isles. Nikki Bate went for a swim off the shore of Famara Beach, near the resort of Caleta de Famara in Lanzarote, but was swept out into big seas moments after warning her family not to enter the water. She screamed for help and her husband Anthony Bate, 56, dived in to try to rescue her. He managed to grab her, but the strong riptide pulled them apart. Tragic: Nikki Bate, pictured with her husband Anthony, drowned while on holiday at Famara beach, in Lanzarote. Anthony tried to save her but the current pulled them apart . Desperately trying to help her he watched as his wife panicked and drowned in front of him. The tragedy happened after Mrs Bate had warned her two sons that the water was too dangerous after they wanted to go body-boarding. After arriving back in the UK, Mr bate, of Barrow, Lancashire, said: 'We spent a few hours paddling in the surf then she said \"in five minutes we're going home\". 'She went for a swim. But unfortunately it's one of the most dangerous beaches in the Canaries. My daughter India said she was shouting for help so then I swam out and reached her. 'The sea was terrible. It was shocking. I've never seen anything like it. 'We were being bashed about and we got separated. She panicked and drowned. It was a little mistake with calamitous consequences and this is the tragedy we're left with. He added: 'We are all devastated but we are being strong.' The family had been staying at their holiday home on the island before the tragic accident last Thursday afternoon. Anthony, a company director, said lifeguards got to the couple within a few minutes, pulled them both back to the beach and battled for at least half an hour to save Nikki. Anthony praised the lifeguards for their efforts. He said: 'They tried tirelessly to revive my wife and were very sensitive, as were the police and ambulance staff.' Mrs Bate drowned in big seas off Famara breach, near Caleta de Famara, Lanzarote, pictured, where the family have a holiday home . He described his wife of 16 years as a wonderful and dedicated mother and said himself and his children India, 14, Nathaniel, 12, and Cameron, 10, will all miss her very much. Anthony met Nikki 20 years ago at the Asda store in Accrington and bonded over their mutual vegetarianism. Nikki, who is originally from Whalley, was a housewife who also volunteered for the Home-Start charity, offering friendship and practical help with families with young children in East Lancashire. She also used to own The Crown Wheel restaurant in King Street, Whalley, which is now the Italian restaurant Amico Mio. The family received consular assistance from the Foreign Office and arrived back in the UK at around 12am on Sunday. The strong currents at Famara Beach have already claimed the life of one Briton - in a tragedy last April. In a chilling echo of Nikki Bate's death, Steve Potter lost his life at the same resort after getting into difficulties while out swimming in April this year. The 43-year-old was dragged from the water unconscious and could not be revived. An ex-patriate, who visited the resort recently, has also described the inherent dangers of the two-mile stretch of beach, a favourite among surfers and kiteboarders.

A pint of beer costs up to 65p more in the south of England than it does in the north. A survey by the Good Pub Guide showed drinkers in Staffordshire enjoy the cheapest ale at an average of just \u00a32.95 a pint while those in London are forced to fork out \u00a33.60. Drinkers in Derbyshire, Shropshire, Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and Country Durham can all raise a toast to enjoying prices of little over \u00a33 a pint. Hard to swallow: Beer drinkers are forking out 65p more for a pint in London than they do in Staffordshire . But boozers in Kent, Buckinghamshire, Surrey and Sussex must drown their sorrows with the knowledge they are being forced to fork out far above the national average of \u00a33.20. Beer brewed by pubs themselves, on the premises, typically cost 40p a pint less than the local average, the guide found. Good Pub Guide spokesman Fiona Stapley told the Daily Mirror: 'People in Staffs have an eye for value and some licencees go to great lengths looking for bargains for customers. Staffordshire, known for its beautiful canals and potteries, sells some of the cheapest beer in Britain with pints costing an average of \u00a32.95 . 'In the South East, big brewers used to own most pubs, which tended to limit the competition. 'But I think people in the South East are simply less careful with their money.' The Guide predicts that\u00a0 around 4,000 . pubs will close in the next year because they are 'stuck in the 1980s', . offering indifferent drink and food, according to a new guide. More than 1,000 new pubs are expected to open, often in former hostelries which have been shuttered for years. Between 2,500 and 4,000 will go out of business, but the guide quotes a successful landlord saying there are too many pubs in the wrong place, chasing the wrong market. Watering hole: The Olive Branch pub in Clipsham, Rutland, was named Pub of the Year . 'The bad pubs are still being culled, just like lions pick off the slowest of the herd. It makes the pub industry more robust and far better placed for the future,' he said. The guide said standards are improving in pubs, amid increasing vocational training among staff, but it called for pubs to name their chefs on menus as part of moves to close the \"absurd status gap\" between TV chefs and those working in pubs. When the guide was launched in 1983 there were a handful of national beer brands, but now more than 7,000 beers are on offer, produced by hundreds of brewers. The Pub of The Year was named as the Olive Branch in Clipsham, Rutland, with other awards including the best landlord (Tim Gray of the Yew Tree in Lower Wield, Hampshire), brewery (Fuller, Smith & Turner), new pub (Bulls Head, Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire), dining pub (Stagg, Titley, Herefordshire) and whisky pub (Bon Accord, Glasgow). More than 4,700 pubs are featured in the guide.",

Retired Cardinal Roger Mahony and other top Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles officials maneuvered behind the scenes to shield molester priests, provide damage control for the church and keep parishioners in the dark, according to church personnel files. The confidential records filed in a lawsuit against the archdiocese disclose how the church handled abuse allegations for decades and also reveal dissent from a top Mahony aide who criticized his superiors for covering up allegations of abuse rather than protecting children. Notes inked by Mahony demonstrate he was disturbed about abuse and sent problem priests for treatment, but there also were lengthy delays or oversights in some cases. Disclosed info: Retired Cardinal Roger Mahony and other top Roman Catholic Archdiocese officials in LA made efforts to shield molester priests, provide damage control for the church and keep parishioners in the dark . The confidential records show how the church handled abuse allegations for decades and also reveal dissent from a top Mahony aide who criticized his superiors for covering up allegations of abuse rather than protecting children . Mahony received psychological reports on some priests that mentioned the possibility of many other victims, for example, but there is no indication that he or other church leaders investigated further. \u2018This is all intolerable and unacceptable to me,\u2019 Mahony wrote in 1991 on a file of the Reverend Lynn Caffoe, a priest suspected of locking boys in his room, videotaping their crotches and running up a $100 phone sex bill while with a boy. Caffoe was sent for therapy and removed from ministry, but Mahony didn't move to defrock him until 2004, a decade after the archdiocese lost track of him. \u2018He is a fugitive from justice,\u2019 Mahony wrote to the Vatican's Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who is now Pope Benedict XVI. \u2018A check of the Social Security index discloses no report of his demise, so presumably he is alive somewhere.\u2019 Caffoe died in 2009, six years after a newspaper reporter found him working at a homeless mission two blocks from a Salinas elementary school. Apology: Mahony was out of town but issued a statement Monday apologizing for his mistakes and saying he had been 'na\u00efve' about the lasting impacts of abuse . Mahony was out of town but issued a statement Monday apologizing for his mistakes and saying he had been \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 about the lasting impacts of abuse. He has since met with 90 abuse victims privately and keeps an index card with each victim's name in his private chapel, where he prays for them daily, he said. The card also includes the name of the molesting priest \u2018lest I forget that real priests created this appalling harm.\u2019 \u2018It remains my daily and fervent prayer that God's grace will flood the heart and soul of each victim, and that their life journey continues forward with ever greater healing,\u2019 Mahony wrote. \u2018I am sorry.\u2019 The church's sex abuse policy was evolving and Mahony inherited some of the worst cases from his predecessor when he took over in 1985, J. Michael Hennigan, an archdiocese attorney, said in a separate series of emails. Priests were sent out of state for psychological treatment because they revealed more when their therapists were not required to report child abuse to law enforcement, as they were in California, he said. At the time, clergy were not mandated sex abuse reporters and the church let the victims' families decide whether to contact police, he added. In at least one case, a priest victimized the children of illegal immigrants and threatened to have them deported if they told, the files show. The files are attached to a motion seeking punitive damages in a case involving a Mexican priest sent to Los Angeles in 1987 after he was brutally beaten in his parish south of Mexico City. When parents complained the Reverend Nicholas Aguilar Rivera molested in LA, church officials told the priest but waited two days to call police \u2014 allowing him to flee to Mexico, court papers allege. At least 26 children told police they were abused during his 10 months in Los Angeles. The now-defrocked priest is believed to be in Mexico and remains a fugitive. The personnel files of 13 other clerics were attached to the motion to show a cover-up pattern, said attorney Anthony De Marco, who represents the 35-year-old plaintiff. Further shielding: The files show Mahony worked to keep molester priests out of state to avoid criminal and civil trouble . In one instance, a memo to Mahony discusses sending a cleric to a therapist who also is an attorney so any incriminating evidence is protected from authorities by lawyer-client privilege. In another instance, archdiocese officials paid a secret salary to a priest exiled to the Philippines after he and six other clerics were accused of having sex with a teen and impregnating her. The exhibits offer a glimpse at some 30,000 pages to be made public as part of a record-setting $660 million settlement. The archdiocese agreed to give the files to more than 500 victims of priest abuse in 2007, but a lawyer for about 30 of the priests fought to keep records sealed. A judge recently ordered the church to release them without blacking out the names of church higher-ups. They echo similar releases from other dioceses nationwide that have shown how church leaders for decades shuffled problem priests from parish to parish, covered up reports of abuse and didn't contact law enforcement. Top church officials in Missouri and Pennsylvania were criminally convicted last year for their roles in covering up abuse, more than a decade after the clergy sex abuse scandal began to unfold in Boston. Mahony, who retired in 2011 after 26 years at the helm of the 4.3-million person archdiocese, has been particularly hounded by the case of the Reverend Michael Baker, who was sentenced to prison in 2007 for molestation \u2014 two decades after the priest confessed his abuse to Mahony. Mahony noted the \u2018extremely grave and serious situation\u2019 when he sent Baker for psychological treatment after the priest told him in 1986 that he had molested two brothers over seven years. Baker returned to ministry the next year with a doctor's recommendation that he be defrocked immediately if he spent any time with minors. Despite several documented instances of being alone with boys, the priest wasn't removed from ministry until 2000. Around the same time, the church learned he was conducting baptisms without permission. Church officials discussed announcing Baker's abuse in churches where he had worked, but Mahony rejected the idea. \u2018We could open up another firestorm \u2014 and it takes us years to recover from those,\u2019 Mahony wrote in an October 6, 2000, memo. \u2018Is there no alternative to public announcements at all the Masses in 15 parishes??? Wow \u2014 that really scares the daylights out of me!!\u2019 The aide, Monsignor Peter Garcia Richard Loomis, noted his dismay over the matter when he retired in 2001 as vicar for clergy, the top church official who handled priestly discipline. In a memo to his successor, Loomis said Baker's attorney disclosed the priest had at least 10 other victims. \u2018We've stepped back 20 years and are being driven by the need to cover-up and to keep the presbyteriate & public happily ignorant rather than the need to protect children,\u2019 Loomis wrote. \u2018The only other option is to sit and wait until another victim comes forward. Then someone else will end up owning the archdiocese of Los Angeles. The liability issues involved aside, I think that course of complete (in)action would be immoral and unethical.\u2019 Mahony preferred targeted warnings at schools and youth groups rather than a warning read at Masses, Hennigan said. Parish announcements were made two years later. Baker, who was paroled in 2011, is alleged to have molested 20 children in his 26-year career. He could not be reached for comment. The files also show Mahony worked to keep molester priests out of state to avoid criminal and civil trouble. One case involved the Monsignor Peter Garcia, a molester whom Mahony's predecessor sent for treatment in New Mexico. Mahony kept Garcia there after a lawyer warned in 1986 that the archdiocese could face \u2018severe civil liability\u2019 if he returned and reoffended. Garcia had admitted raping an 11-year-old boy and later told a psychologist he molested 15 to 17 young boys. \u2018If Monsignor Garcia were to reappear here within the archdiocese, we might very well have some type of legal action filed in both the criminal and civil sectors,\u2019 Mahony wrote to the director of Garcia's New Mexico treatment program. Mahony then sent Garcia to another treatment center, but Garcia returned to LA in 1988 after being removed from ministry. He then contacted a victim's mother and asked to spend time with her younger son, according to a letter in the file. Mahony moved to defrock him in 1989, and Garcia died a decade later.

Chicken nuggets are definitely made of chicken - just maybe not the parts you want to eat. Researchers in Mississippi conducted an 'autopsy' of chicken nuggets from two fast food chains in Jackson and confirmed what we all suspected about the mystery-meat medallions: they aren't too meaty. The first chicken nugget tested was made up of about 50 per cent muscle tissue from the breast or thigh and the rest was made up of unpalatable parts: fat, blood vessels, and nerves. What's in a nugget? Researchers in Mississippi examined two fast-food chains' chicken nuggets and found that half or less than half of the nuggets were made of meat. The rest was made of high-fat chicken parts . The second chicken nugget was even worse with out 40 per cent muscle, with the rest being made up of fat cartilage and bone. The researchers decided not to name the fast food chains. Dr Richard D deShazo, the study's lead researcher, encourages his patients to eat white chicken meat and while chicken nuggets may look white on the inside, looks can be deceiving. 'What has happened is that some companies have chosen to use an artificial mixture of chicken parts rather than low-fat chicken white meat, batter it up and fry it and still call it chicken,' Dr deShazo told Reuters. 'It is really a chicken by-product high in calories, salt, sugar and fat that is a very unhealthy choice. Even worse, it tastes great and kids love it and it is marketed to them.' While it's OK to indulge in the junk food every so often, the problem for deShazo is that some people eat them multiple times a week. Don't make it a habit: Dr deShazo, the lead researcher of the study, said it's OK to eat chicken nuggets every once in a while but he's concerned for the people who eat them multiple times a week . Ashley Peterson, a representative of the National Chicken Council, a non-profit trade group which represents the U.S. chicken industry, argued that consumers weren't being mislead. She pointed out that nutritional information for most fast food chains is available online, and that anything for sale at the grocery store has a list of ingredients. 'Chicken nuggets tend to have an elevated fat content because they are breaded and fried. But it's no secret what is in a chicken nugget,' she said.",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\n(CNN) -- Can we simply enjoy movies without having to fact-check every little thing? Apparently not, because so many people feel compelled to show us how clever they are by attempting to point out factual errors depicted in film after film. News flash: Movies are supposed to be an entertaining experience. They are an escape from reality. If you want to learn history or facts, read a book. Or if you are too lazy to do that, then google it. We have seen this self-aggrandizing spectacle of people fact-checking movies with two recent films. The first is the current box office champion, \"Gravity,\" with the other being \"The Butler.\" \"Gravity,\" which stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, follows a space mission that goes terribly awry. Despite its box office success, a chorus of critics have attacked numerous scientific flaws in the film -- such as pointing out the allegedly inaccurate way Bullock's hair floated in zero gravity. But that's nothing compared to the recent barrage of Twitter attacks launched at the film by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. His tweets ranged from criticizing the direction space debris was depicted as travelling to more nuanced issues such as faulting filmmakers for showing that the Hubble Space Telescope, the International Space Station and a Chinese space station were, \"all in sight lines of one another.\" This is not the guy you want to sit next to in a movie theater during \"Star Wars.\" I can just hear him whispering things such as: \"The Death Star is too big to fly at that rate of speed,\" or \"Yoda could never survive in that atmosphere.\" Look, \"Gravity\" doesn't even pretend to be based on anything more than the screenwriter's imagination. And here's the biggest thing for people like deGrasse Tyson to keep in mind: it's science fiction, for God's sake! You would think the \"fiction\" part of \"science fiction\" is something that an astrophysicist could comprehend. And then there's \"The Butler,\" the Lee Daniels film about a man who served for decades as a butler for various presidents at the White house. This film was attacked by the left and the right for being historically inaccurate. Some have cited errors with the film's account of specific instances of the civil rights movement while others expressed outrage over the way President Ronald Reagan was depicted -- apparently some view Reagan as a deity. Here's a spoiler alert (and by \"spoiler alert,\" I mean a spoiler to people who have never googled or read anything about the film): It was fiction -- that means it was made up. There was no \"Cecil Gaines,\" the butler character played by Forest Whitaker in the film. The film does not even purport to be a bio pic. Sure, it was loosely inspired by the life of Eugene Allen, a man who served as a butler in the White House for 34 years for eight presidents, but the film was a fictionalized account. And we saw similar obsessive fact-checking last year with movies such as \"Argo\" and \"Lincoln.\" I guess we should be thankful that Twitter wasn't around when \"Forrest Gump\" was released because people would have gone crazy with tweets over that one. Can we agree on something? A director who is making a documentary should be required to present an accurate recitation of facts and history. But for all other movies, filmmakers should be afforded creative license to make the movie that fulfills their vision of the story they want to tell, even ones based on real events. Filmmakers are not historians, nor should they be held to such a standard. Consequently, directors must be allowed to add scenes or dialogue that make the film more entertaining, such as the fictionalized depiction in \"Argo\" of American diplomats trying to board a plane to escape from Iran before they are discovered. So here's my advice to all you self-appointed movie fact-checkers who are just waiting to pounce on any mistake you detect in a film to show off how clever you are: Relax. Go to a movie, log off of Twitter, silence your phone, sit back, eat some overpriced cold popcorn that's part of the criminally expensive \"value combo\" and watch the film. You never know -- you might just find that you actually enjoy it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a middle school student:\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- All that glitters may not be gold, but for Colombia's narco-molls the most important thing is that it glitters. Yovanna Guzman was 19 when she met drug  boss Wilber Varela, and she says he showered her with luxuries. Beauty queens, fashion models, actresses or regular girls made good are lovers of drug capos and above all lovers of the finest luxuries that cocaine money can buy. Few are prepared to speak publicly and even less to appear on camera. Those who date mob bosses don't want to blow their cover. It could expose their boyfriends to arrest and themselves to retaliation. In addition, it could bring anti-drug police sniffing, ready to seize ill-gotten gains. One exception is Yovanna Guzman, a former beauty queen and model, with a mane of blond hair and a pneumatic figure -- a sure passport into the narco underworld where cup size is more important than IQ. For eight years, she was the lover of one of Colombia's most ruthless cocaine traffickers, Wilber Varela. He was head of the North Valle Cartel. \"He had two faces. I saw him so tender with the ones he loved, then you see the cartel killings. He always said he was the best of friends and the worst of enemies,\" Guzman said during an interview in Bogota.  Watch Guzman describe Varela and how she met him \u00bb . The Colombian government accused Varela of running tons of cocaine to the United States via Central America in go-fast speedboats and to Europe in small jets. Should drugs be legalized? Sound off below . Authorities put a $5 million bounty on his head. He gained a reputation for brutality during a yearslong dispute with a splinter faction of the same cartel, led by Diego Montoya, who until his capture in 2007 was listed alongside Osama bin Laden on the FBI's list of the 10 most-wanted fugitives. Guzman was 19 when she met Varela. He told her he was a cattle rancher. She didn't ask questions and said she only found out the truth when she saw a Wanted poster with her boyfriend's mug shot. He wooed her with expensive gifts and sponsored her through Chica Med, a second-rate beauty pageant organizers concede was viewed as a cattle market by gangsters looking for new girls. Some mob bosses bought the beauty title as a gift for their molls, though it's not clear whether Varela paid for Guzman's title. \"There were the vacations, the cars and the luxury SUVs and, of course, jewelry. There was always jewelry. But there were small details too like flowers,\" she said. \"Of course, the luxuries don't make you fall in love, but they do dazzle you. When you get dazzled, you get carried away, but then you ask yourself where is the love and my principles?\" Guzman said Varela's first gift to her was a Rolex watch, followed by a Cartier watch, diamonds, jewelry, top-of-the-range sport utility vehicles and luxury apartments. She said she now realizes she was being bought and admits she sold herself. \"I feel all of us have a price up to a point. Sometimes you feel luxuries like the designer clothes, shoes and handbags are important. But afterward you realize you're empty inside,\" she said. Very quickly her drug lord boyfriend locked Guzman in a golden cage. He forbade her to do photo shoots or party with male friends, even though he had a stable of other top model girlfriends. \"He was very jealous, and what's his is his and belongs to nobody else and nobody can touch it, look at it or mess with it,\" she said. As Colombia's law enforcers stepped up the hunt for Varela, Guzman's time with him became less frequent. But she said he always seemed to know where she was or to whom she had talked. At one point, she said, a jealous Varela sent one of his lieutenants to shoot her in the leg. \"When I got shot, I was supposedly never going to walk properly again. The bullet could easily have hit me somewhere else and killed me. But I pulled myself together and I said I'm not going to be crippled,\" she said. What Guzman wouldn't explain was the reason for the punishment shooting. She giggled and promised to reveal the full details in a book she's writing. She said she hopes her experiences will serve as a cautionary tale for other young women on the trail of easy money. Whether or not they will take a leaf out of that book is another matter. Ordinary Colombians seem to have an unshakable attraction to glamorous narco-lifestyles judging by the sky-high ratings of two TV soap operas. The \"Cartel\" tells the story of the rise of the North Valle mob that Varela headed. The sequel, called \"Mafia Dolls,\" portrays women such as Guzman. One of the silicone-enhanced actresses who played a supporting role in both soaps said that since her TV appearances she has received offers from real-life drug dealers, both in Medellin and Cali. \"Those narcos watch TV and are always on the lookout for fresh meat. So I began getting the calls when I appeared in 'The Cartel,' \" she said. \"I got a phone call from a guy who is a showbiz publicist, and he told me a guy from Medellin was offering $7,500 for me to spend the evening with him.\" She said she refused that overture. Days later, a new BMW X5 SUV, with a bow on top, was left outside her home by the same drug trafficker who was trying to woo her. She said she returned the gift but gave no explanation how she found out the return address, given how secretive Colombian mob bosses are. \"All those narcos care about is how big your breasts are. If they want you, the first thing they do is send you to their plastic surgeons to have silicone implants. But it's them who decide how big you should be, not you,\" she went on. Guzman dares tell her story now for a simple reason -- Varela is dead. He was slain last year by one of his power-hungry lieutenants eager to take over the business. It marked the end of a nightmare she walked into with her eyes wide open. \"[When I heard the news], I didn't know whether to be happy or sad. Varela had his good side, but my freedom doesn't have a price,\" she said. \"I felt the golden cage had been flung open, and I could fly again.\"",

Closing arguments will begin August 7, the judge ordered. The long delay may be because of the length of time it will take the legal teams on both sides to review the transcript of the case, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. It's thought to be as much as 4,000 pages long, covering a case that ran for 39 days between March 3 and July 8. Pistorius, 27, admits firing the bullets that killed Steenkamp, but he says he mistakenly thought he was defending himself from an intruder. Prosecutors say the two had an argument and he deliberately murdered the model and law school graduate, who was 29. Following closing arguments, the judge will have to decide whether Pistorius genuinely made a mistake or deliberately murdered his girlfriend. If Judge Thokozile Masipa does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder, she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to a prison term ranging from 15 years to life. South Africa does not have the death penalty. If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know that Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to Phelps, the CNN legal analyst. A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at Masipa's discretion.",

The form player of the men's tennis season after coming back from long-term knee problems, Nadal could have added to his 2008 and 2010 feats by beating David Ferrer and reaching the final of the penultimate tournament on the calendar. However, he lost 6-3 7-5 to his third-ranked compatriot, who will defend his title in Sunday's final against Novak Djokovic. The Serbian earlier kept alive his hopes of being year-end No. 1 for the third successive year by beating 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer in Saturday's opening semifinal. \"I played maybe my best match this season,\" Ferrer said after ending a nine-match losing run to Nadal. \"Paris is very special for me. I made my first final of a grand slam in Roland Garros; last year I won my first Masters 1000 title; now I'm in the final again in Paris.\" Second-ranked Djokovic had to come from behind to win 4-6 6-3 6-2 against the veteran Swiss, who is showing signs of improved form. Both matches were dress rehearsals for the ATP World Tour Finals in London next week, where Nadal and Ferrer will be in Group A along with Tomas Berdych and debutant Stanislas Wawrinka. Defending champion Djokovic and six-time winner Federer will be in Group B with Juan Martin del Potro and Richard Gasquet. \"I was pretty happy with my level of play,\" said Federer, who will equal Ivan Lendl's record 12 consecutive appearances at the season-ending event. \"I wish I could have kept it up for a bit longer and put him under pressure, but Novak battled well to stay in the match in the second set and the third set. \"I had my chances in the second and third sets. Disappointed right now, but overall it was a good week for me.\" On Friday, Federer avenged his Swiss Indoors final defeat by Del Potro -- and the Argentine's week got even worse when he was robbed at Paris' Gare du Nord train station en route to Britain. His confidence will be shaken after losing his most prized possession -- a rosary that was blessed by the Pope in Rome this year, which was in a briefcase stolen as he checked in. \"My Rosary blessed by Pope Francis, I carried it everywhere,\" the 25-year-old told the ATP Tour website. \"That's what matters most to me. I was finishing the check-in and was asked for an autograph. I turned around to sign it and, within 20 seconds, it was stolen.\" Meanwhile, the Italian women's team took a big step towards a fourth Fed Cup title after winning both singles matches on the opening day of the final against an under-strength Russia Saturday. Italy, whose last title came in 2010, saw its top-ranked player Sara Errani thrash Irina Khromacheva 6-1 6-4 after Roberta Vinci battled to a 5-7 7-5 8-6 win against Alexandra Panova. Both Russians were making their debut in the largest team tournament in women's international sport, which featured 97 nations this year, as the country's top 11 players were unavailable. The final clashes with the WTA Tour's Tournament of Champions in Bulgaria, a second-tier end-of-season event where Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenckova lost to Sam Stosur in Saturday's semis and Romania's Simona Halep beat Serbian Ana Ivanovic. The International Tennis Federation, which plans to move the Fed Cup final back a week next season, announced Saturday that Tunisia will be banned from the men's 2014 Davis Cup tournament after refusing to allow one of its players to compete against an Israeli. Malek Jaziri had been due to play Amir Weintraub at last month's Tashkent Challenger. \"There is no room for prejudice of any kind in sport or in society,\" ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti said. \"The ITF board decided to send a strong message to the Tunisian Tennis Federation that this kind of action will not be tolerated by any of our members. \"The board felt that suspension from Davis Cup, a competition that was founded 113 years ago to encourage better understanding through sport, would provide a good lesson for the federation and a fitting penalty for their unfortunate action.\"",

Retired headmaster John Regan was told that he would have to wait a day and a half before his complaint about his bins not being collected would be heard . All he wanted was for his rubbish to be taken away so when the binmen were four days late John Regan decided to find out why. The retired headteacher picked up the phone and called Winchester City Council helpline hoping for a swift answer to his query. But the taped message the 60-year-old father of two received stunned him. He was 'in a 37-hour queue'. Exasperated and, unsurprisingly, not prepared to wait a day and a half for an answer he then called the council's main number, only to be diverted to Hampshire County Council switchboard. Today his rubbish bins had still not been collected, seven days after they were meant to be emptied. Mr Regan, from Winchester, said: 'I just want my rubbish collected. What is so difficult about emptying my bin? He added: 'I rang Winchester council after four days and I was told I was in a 37-hour queue. 'I thought this was ridiculous so I rang their main number but I was then diverted to the county council where the operator said the city council number was overloaded.

Keyboards always seem to get in the way of doing what I want to do -- and nowhere is this as apparent, or frustrating, as on smartphones and tablets. With the recent launch of the iPhone 4S, Apple's not-really-new voice recognition system Siri has been getting a lot of attention. Yet it took the India-based software company Dexetra just eight hours to create the initial version of Iris -- a blatant Android knockoff of Siri. Even the name \"Iris,\" which is the reverse of \"Siri,\" stands for \"Intelligent Rival Imitator of Siri\" according to Dexetra's blog. (And yes, I'm just waiting for the trademark suit from Apple.) Granted, Dexetra wasn't starting completely from scratch. This company had already been working on natural language processing and machine learning -- two notably thorny, complex technologies -- for more than a year. A few days later, Dexetra made an improved version of Iris available as a free app in Google's Android Market and as of this writing it has been installed more than 50,000 times. I put Iris on my Android phone this weekend, and it's amusing. For instance, here's a discussion I had with Iris yesterday: . Me: \"What time is the John Scofield concert at Yoshi's Jazz Club in Oakland tonight?\" Iris: \"I have no idea.\" Me: \"Who is John Scofield?\" Iris: \"John Scofield, born 1951, the musician.\" (Shows a photo of Scofield performing.) Me: \"Where is Yoshi's, Oakland?\" Iris: \"Right now being pulled in by a black hole.\" So Iris is about as entertaining as Siri seems to be. (I don't own an iPhone, but for comparison I've been checking out the STSS Tumblr blog, a crowdsourced collection of weird and wonderful wisdom from Siri.) Still, neither Iris nor Siri seems very useful so far. Fortunately, there are better voice control options on both the iPhone and Android handsets than either Siri or Iris. And they've been around for a while. For some time the Android mobile operating system has had pretty well integrated speech-to-text functionality (Google Voice Actions). I use this often for texting, searching, navigating and e-mailing on the go. Also, whenever I bring up a keyboard in any Android app, there's a microphone option for voice entry. Generally it recognizes pretty well what I want to say or do. If Android guesses wrong, I can use the keyboard to correct it, and it does seem to learn over time. Then there is Vlingo, a voice control app for all the major smartphone platforms. I've tried it, and for some tasks it works reasonably well. On the iPhone, Siri does integrate with some of Apple's own productivity tools (such as the calendar). But as my CNN.com colleague Mark Milian pointed out, Siri can't yet execute many basic commands like taking a picture. Most importantly, Siri doesn't integrate with any third-party iOS apps, such as Shazam or Tweetdeck. Given Apple's closed iOS ecosystem, it's an open question whether such integration will ever happen. Besides Siri, there are other iOS apps and tools that provide some voice control. ExtremeTech recently published a list. Such baby steps are important -- but on any mobile platform, we're still a long, long way from phones that you can just talk to and they'll do what you say. This is frustrating from the consumer perspective. Smartphones are, first and foremost, phones. They're supposed to be for talking. Typing on any mobile device, through a physical or virtual keyboard, is a chore. That's why QR codes are getting popular -- they eliminate the need to type on a mobile device. The challenge of typing on handheld devices is exactly why the kind of voice control Scotty expected is such an alluring and intuitive idea. Eventually we'll probably get there. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.",

Manor team chief John Booth and Virgin supremo Richard Branson are due to announce the long-awaited sponsorship tie-up on Tuesday.

Currently there are 12 teams, with the name Virgin Racing amongst the newcomers for 2010, joining Lotus F1 Racing, Campos Meta 1 and US F1 Team. The issue of the 13th entry remains unresolved, although Sauber are widely expected to be granted a place on next year's grid following a meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in Monaco on December 11. Peter Sauber last week regained control of the team he sold to BMW four years ago after the German manufacturing giant's withdrawal from the sport. \"I am very relieved about that development,\" the 66-year-old Swiss, who is hopeful the FIA will now look favorably on the team's entry, told reporters. \"It would have been a crying shame had one of the best Formula One factories closed down. Regarding the slot on the grid, I am very confident we will be given a final confirmation very shortly.\" The Formula One Commission are due to discuss Toyota's fate next week, again in Monaco on Wednesday. The Japanese manufacturer pulled out of F1 at the end of last season, despite during the summer signing the new Concorde Agreement that bound them to the sport for the next three years. Speculation has surfaced of late regarding a potential takeover, yet it is unclear whether a buyer would automatically be granted an entry on the basis of Toyota's signature on the Concorde. In a statement, the FIA said: \"Toyota Motorsport GmbH remains formally bound by the Concorde Agreement to put forward a team for participation, though it has indicated that it will not be in a position to do so. \"An announcement will be made regarding this entry in due course.\"",

Terry Williams hugs her two boys -- Jake, left, and Zack -- in 2006, before she says toxic cabin air made her sick. They are mostly pilots and flight attendants who suspect they've been poisoned in their workplace -- on board the aircraft they fly. Clement Furlong, University of Washington professor of medicine and genome sciences, leads a team of scientists who have been collecting the samples for 2 \u00bd years. Furlong said his team is a few months away from finalizing a blood analysis test that will be able to definitely confirm whether the study participants were indeed poisoned by toxic fumes. Results of Furlong's research could expand recognition of what a select group of researchers believes is a largely unrecognized risk of flying: the chance that poisonous fumes enter the cabin. \"There's a danger of inhaling compounds that are coming out of the engine,\" said Furlong in his laboratory.  See a diagram of how the air is circulated \u00bb . The air we breathe on board a plane is a 50-50 mix of filtered, recirculated air and so-called \"bleed air\" -- which bleeds off the engines, and then is pressurized and cooled before being sent into the cabin through vents. If an engine oil seal leaks, aviation engineers and scientists say, the bleed air can become contaminated with toxins. In 2002 the National Academies of Sciences' National Research Council reported \"contaminant exposures result from the intake of chemical contaminants (e.g., engine lubricating oils, hydraulic fluids, deicing fluids and their degradation products) into the Environmental Control System and then into the cabin.\" Of particular concern are toxic anti-wear agents in the oil, designed to prolong an engine's life, called tricresyl phosphates. \"The engine seals fail and there's very potent toxins that can come on board,\" said Furlong. Neuropsychologist Sarah Mackenzie Ross of University College London studied 27 British pilots who claimed they had inhaled contaminated air and subsequently had difficulty processing information and slowed reaction times. Her testing confirmed their symptoms. \"They did appear to underperform on tasks that required attention, processing speed, reaction time, and what we call executive functioning, which is high-level decision making,\" said Ross. Former flight attendant Terry Williams believes she is a victim of such a \"fume event.\" She complains of debilitating migraine headaches, tremors, and blind spots in her field of vision. \"It's been so constant and just continues to worsen so it's extremely frustrating,\" said Williams, who is suing Boeing, the owner of McDonnell Douglas, which made the MD-82 aircraft on which she worked. \"I'm frustrated that I don't feel any better and it's over two years after the exposure.\" Boeing told CNN, \"It is our belief that air quality on airplanes is healthy and safe.\" In its response to Williams' suit, the company said: \"The potential for bleed air contamination has been known through the aviation industry for many years.\" But Boeing denies any responsibility for Terry Williams' illness. While Williams' symptoms appear to be quite rare, it appears that fume events occur with regularity. A British study for the House of Lords found fume events in 1 of every 2,000 flights. In the U.S., airlines are required to report \"fume events\" to the Federal Aviation Administration. There were 108 such reports last year. So why wouldn't more flight attendants, pilots and passengers suffer symptoms? Furlong said a small percentage of people (how small is not known) appear to be highly sensitive to the most toxic chemicals. They may be genetically disposed to a strong reaction, possessing multiple genes of metabolizing proteins in their livers, or temporarily have high enzyme levels (which can be triggered by prescription drugs) that will act on the inhaled chemicals to magnify their toxicity. \"If you happen to be taking a medication that turns on the protein that converts pre-toxin to very potent toxin, you've got an issue,\" said Furlong. As a result, someone sitting next to a victim may have inhaled the same contaminated fumes, but not suffer the same reaction. How might you know that you may have been exposed to a \"fume event\" while flying? Experts say the telltale sign is a \"dirty sock\" smell. That's butyric acid from engine oil, which itself is not highly toxic. But along with it comes the deadly nonodorous compounds tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate and mono-ortho-cresyl phosphate. Boeing's new plane, the 787 Dreamliner, has been designed so that air entering the cabin from outside will not \"bleed\" off the engines.

Columbus, Ohio, firefighter David Santuomo shot his two dogs in his home's basement, prosecutors say. Columbus firefighter David P. Santuomo, 43, took Sloopy and Skeeter to his home's basement, suspended them from a pipe near the ceiling and fired at least 11 shots from a .22-caliber rifle fitted with a homemade silencer, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney Ron J. O'Brien said. Santuomo then wrapped the carcasses in plastic and dumped them in a trash bin behind Firehouse 27, where he worked, O'Brien said. \"This is pretty heinous,\" said Cheri Miller, spokeswoman for the Capital Area Humane Society, which carried out a search warrant in Santuomo's home. The humane society has limited law enforcement powers in Franklin County. Santuomo pleaded guilty in June to two misdemeanor counts of improperly killing a companion animal and a felony count of possession of a criminal tool. Santuomo had fashioned a makeshift silencer by taping a 2-liter soda bottle to the end of the rifle. The incident happened in December. Miller said appalled fellow firefighters turned Santuomo in to authorities. \"There were reports that he was bragging about this,\" she said. Santuomo initially told investigators the dogs had ingested antifreeze and he killed them to put them out of their misery, Miller said. However, after necropsies showed the dogs were not poisoned, the firefighter admitted shooting them because he couldn't afford to board them, she said. Public records show Santuomo has twice filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and underwent a home foreclosure in 2003. The Columbus Division of Fire has received more than 2,000 outraged e-mails and calls from the public, said Battalion Chief David Whiting, the department's spokesman. \"People are not very happy,\" he said. \"We had people say they should do to him what he's done to the dogs. A lot of people want him fired. They don't want him coming into their house. They're worried about their animals; they're worried about their kids. They'd just as soon let their house burn down if he shows up.\" The Division of Fire has concluded an internal investigation, including interviews with Santuomo, Whiting said. The report now goes to Fire Chief Ned Pettus Jr., who will schedule a disciplinary hearing. Punishment, if any, could range from a verbal reprimand to firing, Whiting said. With appeals and possible arbitration, the whole process could take a month or more, he said. In the meantime, Santuomo is working in the division's fire alarm office, \"where he is not dealing face to face with the public,\" Whiting said. If he remains employed with the fire division, he will return to his regular assignment, though that could bring a new set of challenges, Whiting added. \"If someone did this that worked next to you at work, how would you feel about working with him?\" Whiting asked. \"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. ... There are a lot of options.\" Santuomo has only minor disciplinary matters, such as tardiness, in his record, Whiting said. Santuomo was sentenced to 90 days in jail, to be served in 10-day increments over the next two years. He also has to pay $4,500 in restitution, perform 200 hours of community service, stay away from companion animals for five years and write a letter of apology to be published in the local newspaper and the International Association of Firefighters magazine, the humane society's Miller said. Santuomo's attorney said that his client is remorseful over his actions and that people need to temper their outrage. \"It's the same old story. They couldn't care less about people and they love animals,\" lawyer Sam Shamansky said. The firefighter, who could not be reached for comment, has no criminal history other than traffic violations, Shamansky said. \"It, of course, was a heinous act, and it's an act for which he's sorry and has accepted responsibility,\" Shamansky said of the dog killings. \"He's been punished appropriately, and I think it's now time for the public to practice what they preach and show a little forgiveness and mercy. Maybe that might be a novel approach.\"",

Marissa Alexander was convicted of aggravated-assault with a deadly weapon, which caused a furor when her supporters compared it to the self-defense case of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted earlier this year of murdering an unarmed black teenager. The case drew criticism from civil . rights groups concerned about self-defense laws and mandatory minimum . sentencing rules, but it received little attention outside north Florida . until the Zimmerman case. New trial: Marissa Alexander at her bond hearing Nov. 13, 2013, in Jacksonville, Florida. Alexander is getting a new trial after a court overturned her 20-year prison sentence for firing what she called a warning shot at her husband . Free for now: Although no one was injured in Alexander's case, the court gave her a 20-year prison sentence under the state's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines. Critics cried racism and their case was strengthened after George Zimmerman was found not guilty . Although no one was injured in . Alexander's case, the court gave her a 20-year prison sentence under the . state's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines because she had fired a . gun during the assault. A state appeals court ruled in September that Alexander, who is black, deserved a new trial because the judge failed to properly instruct the Jacksonville, Florida jury about her self-defense argument. She was convicted in May 2012. 'This news is vindication for Marissa and all the women who have become criminalized for exercising their basic right to defend themselves and their children,' Angie Nixon of Florida New Majority, a social justice organization, said of Alexander's release. Zimmerman was arrested for killing Trayvon Martin in 2012 and was acquitted of murder and manslaughter in July 2013. Under the so-called Stand Your Ground clause which was added to Florida's self-defense law in 2005, people who use deadly force to defend themselves from serious injury - rather than retreating to avoid confrontation - can be immune from prosecution. Zimmerman never sought immunity under Stand Your Ground, instead relying on a standard self-defense law. Alexander, who had never been arrested before, has said she fired a bullet to scare off her husband when she felt he was threatening her. No one was hurt, but the judge in the case said he was bound by state law to sentence her to 20 years in prison after she was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Racism? The case drew criticism from civil rights groups concerned about self-defense laws and mandatory minimum sentencing rules, but it received little attention outside north Florida until the Zimmerman case . Alexander's Stand Your Ground claim was . rejected because she left the house during the confrontation to retrieve . a gun from her car, returning to fire a shot near her husband Rico . Gray's head. A slightly built woman who stands 5 feet 2 inches, Alexander said her 245-pound husband was about to attack her when she fired into a kitchen wall during the August 2010 incident. He had previously been convicted of domestic violence for attacking her. Prosecutors said the shot endangered Gray. At the time, Alexander had an active restraining order against her husband and she carried a concealed weapons permit. State Attorney Angela Corey, who oversaw the prosecution of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, has stood by the handling of Alexander's case. Corey said she believes that Alexander aimed the gun at the man and his two sons, and that the bullet she fired could have ricocheted and hit any of them. Stood her ground?

Some Mets fans feel the $400 million stadium-name deal is a bad one for all parties in these economic times. Though the Mets played exhibition games there earlier this month, they will officially debut their new home, Citi Field, against the visiting San Diego Padres. The $800 million-plus Queens facility is undoubtedly a state-of-the-art baseball complex with many modern upgrades from the Mets' home for the past 44 years, Shea Stadium, which is still in the process of being demolished a few hundreds yards away. One lifelong Mets fan summed up his emotions about saying goodbye to Shea and hello to Citi by saying: \"It was time for a new stadium, but I'm going to miss Shea very much.\" The controversy arises not from the disappearance of the venerated old stadium but from the fact that rather than attach the iconic Shea name to the new ballpark, in November 2006 the Mets entered into an agreement with Citigroup for naming rights for the new stadium. Reports have put the value of the deal at $400 million spread out in payments of $20 million per year over the course of the next 20 years. That would make it one of the most lucrative stadium naming arrangements in history. According to the Mets, besides the naming rights for Citi Field, \"The fully integrated partnership includes Citi brand and business unit presence throughout the new ballpark.\" While other corporations have invested in similar deals in the past, the financial crisis has focused particular attention on Citigroup, the Mets, and the practice of paying vast sums of money for what is essentially a long-term advertisement. Citigroup, which now does business as Citi, has been the recipient of billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded bailout money over the past year, causing many to question the prudence of $400 million going toward branding Citi Field, especially when Citigroup cut nearly 75,000 jobs in 2008, capped by 50,000 announced in November. Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich, D-Ohio, has been an outspoken critic of the deal. He has called attention to the issue of corporate spending discretion, or lack thereof, particularly when jobs are at risk. \"At the same time they're defending this $400 million stadium-naming deal, they lay off 50,000 people. Now, how many people could you employ for $400 million?\" The Mets claim that the construction of Citi Field created more than 6,000 temporary full-time equivalent jobs, with approximately 1,000 new positions resulting from ongoing operations at the ballpark. One person whose job isn't at risk is Mets all-star third baseman David Wright. One of the franchise's most popular and marketable players, Wright is careful not to make any \"errors\" when confronted with the controversy surrounding his new Citi Field home. \"I don't comment on things that I don't know about. I'm a baseball player, so I go out there and worry about my swing,\" he said.  Watch fans give views on Citi Field name game \u00bb . Kucinich conceded that paying to name a stadium is indeed \"great advertising except for one thing, the American taxpayers have invested heavily in these banks and the bailout fund should not be used for this purpose.\" He advocates that the government, now a direct investor in Citigroup, has the obligation to monitor all aspects of how federal bailout funds are used, which in Kucinich's opinion includes any marketing or promotional endeavors. Not all Mets fans agree. One ardent fan said he's happy his hard-earned tax dollars are going to help fund the Mets' new stadium. \"A lot of people pay for advertisements every day. We shouldn't be ashamed of it. Taxpayer money goes to waste on a lot of other things. Let's go Mets, I say!\" But another fan said, \"If it is indeed our tax money that is actually running the stadium, I wish that I wouldn't have to pay as much money to go see a game.\" A group of fellow fans, many liking the sound of a \"Mets rebate\" in these troubling economic times, warmly greeted his idea before an exhibition game against Boston on April 3. David Wright and the rest of the New York Mets, along with 42,000 boisterous fans, will formally open the new ballpark when the first regular-season game there begins at 7 p.m. Monday.",

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\nChina's State Council recently handed down an \"authoritative White Paper\" on the \"one country, two systems\" model as applied to Hong Kong. Deng Xiaoping, a reformist leader and the man who launched China toward becoming the world's largest economy, invented the idea originally for Taiwan, but events transpired to make Hong Kong the test bed. That tiny test bed is currently turning into a big headache for China's leaders as 787,767 Hong Kongers voted last week in an unauthorized referendum for what they consider acceptable models of democratically nominating and electing their chief executive -- the city's top politician -- in 2017. At present, Hong Kong's chief executive -- currently Leung Chun-ying -- is selected by a 1,200-member election committee with the approval of Beijing. Many are voting more against the White Paper, which maintained China's \"comprehensive jurisdiction\" over the city, than for one of the models. They, and nearly the entire legal profession in Hong Kong, object to the paper calling judges \"administrators\" who must take orders from Beijing. Hong Kong follows the British-derived common law system. The rule of law, insured by judges independent of the administration is, according to nearly everyone, the key distinguisher between the legal system in Hong Kong and that holding sway on the mainland. Autonomy unchallenged until now . At the core of \"one country, two systems\" is just how autonomous the smaller system can be against the larger, dominant one.  And one thing most dependent on that \"high degree of autonomy\" Deng promised is the rule of law. This autonomy has been largely unchallenged since 1997, when Britain handed over the city to China. But today the issue of just how democratic Beijing will permit the election of the next chief executive to be has brought the whole concept of genuine autonomy into doubt. Deng and his successors have repeatedly told Taiwan -- which China considers to be a renegade province -- under this concept that it could keep its army, currency and separate political system, just as long as it stuck to there being \"one China.\" But the White Paper on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region spells out a very different version of autonomy, one that's closer in terms of central control to the iron fist actually practiced in the Tibet Special Administrative Region rather than the velvety promises being given to Taiwan. Hong Kongers are up in arms over this -- so far -- typographic crackdown on autonomy.  But the Taiwanese are also not amused. And here's why this drama matters outside China. China has shown first with Japan over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands and now with Vietnam, that it takes its claims to the whole South China Sea (which includes Taiwan) seriously. China is very sensitive about any hint of separatist or secessionist activity. Beijing may not see the difference between their concerns for state security and unification, and the local actions in Hong Kong that actually have nothing to do with secession from China. There are a lot of missiles, ships, submarines, fighters and troops faced off across the strait between Taiwan and the mainland. \"One country, two systems\" is supposedly the peaceful alternative to war for reunification with Taiwan. If Hong Kong shows \"one country, two systems\" was a promise given by Beijing with no intent to keep its treaty-given word, Taiwan is very unlikely to agree to reunify with mainland China under those terms. Even an international treaty supposedly protecting Taiwan's \"high degree of autonomy\" would little persuade if there's a Hong Kong crackdown with no international reaction. Nobody knows what the replacement for \"one country, two systems\" should be. China is increasingly throwing its weight around, facing off with Vietnam, the Philippines and the United States. Hong Kong is part of this larger context of China becoming aggressive and assertive -- and if it's willing to take on all these nations at the same time, it's not going to let a few hundred thousand people intimidate it. Beijing promises . Another reason it matters becomes clear in the paper's timing, just before last week's \"people's referendum\" on political reform. In 2007, Beijing promised Hong Kong could elect its chief executive by universal suffrage in 2017. Since it already directly elects over half its legislature, Hong Kong is well ahead of the rest of China in political reform. Hong Kong has long led the way to both economic and political change in China. The village election system Deng started in 1982 was directly modeled on Hong Kong village elections, and recent elections of District Boards in a number of mainland cities drew once more on Hong Kong's own invention of District Boards in 1982. If China is going to start making a transition from authoritarian dictatorship to something closer to democracy, the Hong Kong test bed is the place to start. Stopping reform in Hong Kong very likely means killing it in the rest of China. This matters to the rest of world because democracies have dominated the globe economically and politically for over a century.  But now, with China soon taking the top spot economically, will democratic habits of discussion, voting and compromise collide with an elite more accustomed to giving orders that are obeyed? That's what makes the White Paper on Hong Kong so important, and so worrying.  Not only does it take a rather imperious tone; it was issued in seven languages, so much as stating to the rest of world: \"pay attention, what we do in Hong Kong is our business and no one else's, whatever an international treaty like the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration might say.\" Japan, with treaty claims to the Diaoyu/Senkkaku Islands; Vietnam, already in dispute with China; and the United States, which claims the South China Sea is international waters, according to treaty, take note.",

A former professor charged with viewing child pornography from his first-class seat on a commercial flight to Boston will be spared his jail sentence if he sticks to the terms of his probation. A Boston judge suspended Grant Smith's 2 1/2-year sentence after the Salt Lake City father of two pleaded guilty on Thursday to possessing child pornography. Smith is instead placed on five years' probation, must continue sex offender treatment, comply with Utah sex offender registry requirements and follow restrictions on contact with children and Internet use. Off the hook: Grant Smith, 50, a former engineering professor at the University of Utah, pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography on Thursday sparing him jail time . Smith, 50, was a University of Utah engineering professor, recently divorced, before he resigned from his position several weeks after his 2011 arrest and being placed on administrative leave. A fellow first-class passenger reported Smith viewing pornographic images of young girls on his laptop during a November flight, according to prosecutors. Caught: The divorced father of two young children was arrested after a fellow passenger on a flight into Boston saw him looking at the photos on his laptop while in first class in 2011 . Delta passenger Kurt Wade, who broke down in tears while recounting the experience, took a cell phone photo of Smith viewing the pictures before alerting a flight attendant. 'He kept scrolling through the pictures and they became sexual and explicit,' Wade told Fox News. 'Little by little they were semi-nude, then completely nude. Just terrible, terrible stuff. It was kind of sad. Tough stuff to see,' he said. Wade says Smith began to erase the files after a flight attendant told him to turn off his computer that was purchased with grant money while an adjunct professor. 'Even as I was trying to explain it [to an air steward], I broke down. I couldn't contain it. So disturbing what was going on,' said Wade. He also alerted police himself, sending officers to greet their plane at its arrival at Boston Logan International Airport. He added: 'When I was in the interview room with forensic computer police down the hall, they confirmed for me there were other images of sexual activity with grown ups.' When asked if he considered himself a hero, he added: 'No. I think any common sense person would see this and understand what was going on.' Speaking to the Associated Press, Wade added: \u2018I feel bad for a lot of people but mostly for these innocent girls. He\u2019s got two young kids and these kids are innocent victims of their father\u2019s behaviour.\u2019 Horrific: Fellow passenger Kurt Wade broke down in tears while recounting the disturbing images he saw on Smith's computer that he says grew worse and worse . The images were mostly of girls between eight and 10 years old, naked or nearly naked, engaging in simulated sex acts. 'These weren't photos of a child in the bath that a parent might keep,' Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said of the images. 'These were explicitly sexual and extremely disturbing.' Some of the pictures were of children as young as six, the prosecutor said. All files were ones downloaded from a website but police say they also found photos on his cell phone of young girls seen in parks and airports. Attorney and victim's advocate Wendy Murphy told WCVB at the time: 'The notion that someone would be so bold as to view it in public is extraordinary and I'm not sure what the explanation is. 'What we have is the equivalent of a confession. Someone who not only sees it but is smart enough to take a picture of it is very solid evidence. 'Reporting it immediately to law enforcement, law enforcement then being able to do their own immediate investigation - that's a very strong case - at least at this point.' Investigators from Massachusetts State Police told NewsCenter 5's Cheryl Fiandaca that Smith was travelling to Boston to attend a conference for the Material Research Society. Smith, a materials science and engineering professor, has two bachelor\u2019s degrees and a doctorate, and had worked at the university for 14 years.",

But according to a Kenyan intelligence official, the small shop concealed an ominous secret. It was rented by the Al-Shabaab terrorists, or their associates, who within a year would carry out an attack on the upscale shopping mall. The information -- revealed Friday to CNN by the source, who is close to the investigation into the attack -- suggests the Somalian terror organization had been planning the operation at least that long. How the team of terrorists got their weapons and explosives into the mall without notice is a central part of the investigation into the attack, which left at least 67 people dead and parts of the upscale mall in ruins. The Kenya Red Cross said Friday that 61 people remain unaccounted for. Some could be buried in the rubble of the partially collapsed mall. At least five of the terrorists also died before Kenyan forces were finally able to bring the siege to an end on Tuesday. The terrorists stormed the building Saturday. On a Twitter account believed to be run by Al-Shabaab, the group promised more attacks to come. \"The mesmeric performance by the #Westgate Warriors was undoubtedly gripping, but despair not folks, that was just the premiere of Act 1,\" according to a tweet posted Thursday. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the tweet, but CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said the account, which has also posted links to statements from Shabaab leader Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, appears to be legitimate, even if not \"100% authenticated.\" Several Twitter accounts attributed to Al-Shabaab have been shut down in recent days, likely for violating the company's rules against promoting violence in tweets. While Kenyan Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku said Friday that eight suspects are being held for questioning in the attack, authorities are increasingly concerned that some of the attackers managed to escape alongside fleeing civilians in the aftermath of the initial attack, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN. On Thursday, a Kenyan counterterrorism source told CNN that one of the suspects is an injured Kenyan who was being evacuated when a machine gun magazine fell out of his pocket, leading to suspicion he was among the automatic-weapon toting terrorists who roamed the mall killing civilians. He is being held in a military hospital, the source said. Among the suspects are three people picked up near the Ugandan border, the Kenyan official who revealed information about the mall store told CNN. CNN's Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta; Nima Elbagir reported from Nairobi; CNN's Neda Fashbaf also contributed to this report .",

The mother of twins arrested for alleged looting in Brixton has claimed that she thought her two sons had gone to the gym. Linette Livingstone said she was horrified to discover that her 19-year-old sons Icha and Micha had both been arrested following Sunday's disturbances. The pair were some of the first people to be remanded in custody over the alleged looting. They are accused of taking part in the raid of a Curry's store in Brixton. Arrested: Icha and Micha Livingstone are both in custody for their part in alleged looting in Brixton, but their mother claimed they should have been at the gym . The judge said he was remanding the defendants in custody because he ruled they may rejoin the rioting if they were released. But Ms Livingston, 58, said her two sons were 'good boys' and that 'they don't need to steal.' Speaking to the Evening Standard, she said: 'That is not how I raised them. 'They were just in the area . but the police rounded everyone up and now they are in prison. It will . kill them. 'They are not street wise, they are not like that.' The twins' case is one countless cases being dealt with at magistrates courts across the capital, with sitting being held late into the night. Detained: Police arrest a suspect outside the Curry's store in Brixton, where the twins are alleged to have taken part in the looting . More than 30 people - mostly teenagers . or in their early twenties - appeared in custody at Camberwell . magistrates' court and were remanded as a result of the anarchy. Among those was Byron Cawley, 19, of West Norwood who pleaded guilty to burglary of the Iceland Store in Croydon. He said he was a good guy who had been swept up in anarchy. Appearing via videolink, he told the court: 'I didn't go out to cause trouble or anything. I just got caught up in the wrong situation, I'm not into crime or anything, I just saw this opportunity for food and I didn't really think.' District Judge Tan Ikram refused him bail until he returns to court tomorrow, possibly for sentence. Caught on camera: Shereka Leigh was captured trying on trainers stolen from a sports shop in Tottenham following the riots . Elsewhere in London the mother of one . of the women caught on CCTV looting the Tottenham branch of JD Sports . has spoken of her shame.

'A bad person': Leigh's mother said her daughter causes her trouble and that they no longer speak as she doesn't want anything to do with her . Ms Robinson told the Daily Telegraph: 'The first I knew of it was when I switched on the television . and saw her trying on the shoes. I couldn't believe it, but lots of . people started to ring me and say that's Shereka on the news. We fell . out earlier this year and have not spoken since May. 'She . can be a bad person and causes me trouble so I don't want to have . anything to do with her. She can be aggressive and we no longer speak.' 'All I care about is my little four-year-old grandson, Kevantae, but I haven't seen him for a while.' She continued: 'It makes me said to see what is happening in London. People have worked hard to build up their businesses but then they are having them destroyed by the looters and people burning them down.' Leigh had spent most of her life in Tottenham, living in a council flat after becoming pregnant at 17. She later moved to a flat in the High Road, where Saturday's trouble flared. She was later evicted after complaints from neighbours. One resident told the Telegraph: 'She was evicted about four weeks ago and we don't know where she has gone now.

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\nAn Oregon man accused of killing his girlfriend while they were on a hike six years ago tried but failed to collect on her $1 million life insurance policy, it has been revealed. Stephen Wagner Nichols, 40, of Bend, was arrested this month at San Francisco International Airport after Oregon authorities alerted California officers that he would be arriving on a flight from China. He had been secretly indicted in April on a murder charge in the death of 23-year-old Rhonda Casto, which had previously been thought an accident, when she fell 100 feet on a steep, narrow path in March 2009. Heartbreaking: Family members say Rhonda Casto, 23, left behind a young daughter, and confirmed that she was dating Stephen Nichols, now aged 40, at the time of her death . Killer boyfriend? Nichols (left), was arrested at San Francisco International Airport on February 12 in connection with Casto's death (right). Her falling during a hike was ruled accidental at the time . He did not appear to have been a suspect in the death of his nine-years-younger girlfriend death when her lifeless body was found on March 16, 2009. Investigators have not revealed if they believe Nichols pushed her or how she may have fallen about a mile from a trailhead in the Columbia River Gorge, 45 miles east of Portland. Court documents show Nichols and Casto became romantically involved in 2005 and had a daughter, who is now six, according to The Oregonian . It was not clear who has custody of the girl. The papers reveal that the couple each bought a $1million life insurance policy in late 2008 from MetLife and named each other as beneficiaries, records show. Their daughter was named as contingent beneficiary. Nichols sued MetLife after it denied his $1million claim. The company said the insurance policy was void because of omissions on the application. MetLife asserted in a counterclaim that \"it is unclear whether plaintiff/counterclaim defendant Steven Wagner Nichols was involved in the murder of Rhonda Casto,\" according to a June 2011 opinion written by U.S. District Judge Ancer Haggerty. If he was, the company said, he may not be entitled to the money under Oregon law. Consequences: If convicted, Nichols could face 25 years to life in prison for Casto's (pictured) murder . In October, Haggerty ruled that the $1million be put in an interest-bearing account under the court's control. MetLife's attorneys agreed that if Nichols was not entitled to the money, it would be given to the couple's daughter. Casto's mother, Julia Anne Simmons, filed a wrongful-death suit against Nichols that Haggerty dismissed. It was later moved to Multnomah County Circuit Court and put on hold in December because the case is \"under review by the Hood River County prosecutor's office,\" according to court documents. Nichols is being held without bail in an Oregon jail, and he is scheduled to appear in court March 3. The case has similarities to one in Colorado, where a man was charged with pushing his wife 140 feet from a cliff in Rocky Mountain National Park, where they were hiking in 2012 to celebrate their anniversary. Harold Henthorn, 58, stood to benefit from three life insurance policies totaling $4.5 million, court documents said. Ms Simons told FOX 12 at the time of Casto\u2019s death: 'I think about her last moments, and what she was thinking when she fell. Narrow: At the time, Casto's death was ruled accidental. It was then believed that she slipped of the trail. Pictures of the Eagle Creek Trail show how narrow it becomes at points . 'How she's not going to get to see her daughter take her first steps. And how I'm never going to get to see my daughter again.' Not many details were released about Casto's death at the time, other than that a 'male companion' (now identified as Nichols), called 911 around 6pm to say she had fallen off a ledge while they were hiking the Eagle Creek Trail . The popular hiking destination has been the scene of other accidents in the past, due to a few narrow sections that drop off on one side into a ravine. The trail was even more dangerous that day due to a battering of sleet and hail that made the trail slippery. Casto was one of four hikers who either fell to their death or died of exposure on Columbia River Gorge trails like Eagle Creek that year. 'The trail is very steep and narrow there, and it's been pretty wet and slippery,' Hood River County sheriff's Deputy Matt English told The Oregonian in 2009. 'There was still snow on the ground down near the parking lot.' It's currently unclear why Casto's case was reopened and the cause of death switched to homicide. Nichols is currently being held without bail and his next court appearance is scheduled for March 3 at 11am.",

While sales of Apple's iPhone 5C are said to be floundering in the U.S and China, its original model is slowly becoming a collector's item and selling for hundreds of pounds.

The original iPhone has a 3.5-inch, . 160-pixel per inch screen - only half an inch smaller than the current . iPhone 5S and with 166 fewer pixels per inch. The phone is said to come with five hours of battery life and 16 hours of audio playback. A recent video from EverythingApplePro found the original model actually outperformed some of the more recent models in terms of performance. The fan site tested all eight handsets, from the original to the new model, plus the 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5 and 5C. Each of the handsets were 'freshly restored and not jailbroken' meaning they each had the same default settings and all applications were force closed beforehand. During tests, the newer models all booted up first, yet the original phone booted up faster than the iPhone 4. Apple's iPhone 3G was the slowest to boost.

When 26-year-old Sophie Linfield put on her blue British Airways cabin crew suit and headed to work earlier this year, she could never have expected the Transatlantic trip she was working on to end with a proposal from one of Britain's wealthiest entrepreneurs. But this was no indecent proposal. Sophie, who had been tending to Ultimo chief Michelle Mone in the First Class cabin, made such an impression on the billionaire businesswoman that Mone handed the BA employee her details and implored her to enter a competition she was holding to find 'real women' to model the lingerie brand's latest collections. Bemused Sophie put the experience aside. But when she landed, something compelled her to call Mone's PA, who asked Sophie to send in a natural photograph of herself and fill in an entry form - which she did. Winning curves: Air hostess Sophie Linfield (left) winner of the Real Women competition and gorgeous Angela Wheeler (right) 'I got my brother's girlfriend to take a photo of me in the garden, just wearing jeans and T-shirt,' Sophie says. 'But I didn't hear anything back for a few weeks, so I just chalked it up as one of those crazy things that happen. But then after a month, I had a call saying I'd won. I couldn't believe it.'

'Fortunately, all ten of us taking part in the shoot had been chatting all week on Facebook, so when it came to posing on the day, I felt like I was among friends. 'The photographer was so nice, and Michelle came down on the day, which was lovely.' Despite her nerves, Sophie says that posing in her underwear gave her a huge and unexpected confidence boost. 'It made me realise that we are all different. Women come in all shapes and sizes,' she said. 'We can't all have bodies like celebrities - we don't have chefs and personal trainers. But everyone is beautiful in their own way.' Such was the transformation that . Sophie says she would now be happy to give her delighted fiance Nick, . also 26, a treat ahead of their wedding next year. 'I . have never been one for nice underwear,' she says. 'I have a drawer of . mismatched knickers and bras. But Ultimo gave us the lingerie we were . wearing on the day, and a few other nice pieces, so my underwear drawer . has been transformed.' Now I wouldn't think twice about posing for my boyfriend in lingerie and heels,' she laughs. Thousands of women entered the national contest, which is held annually to raise money for charity.

UPDATED: . 08:23 EST, 26 August 2012 . It is an audacious gamble that could determine who the next US president will be. In a last-ditch attempt to reconnect with the American people, Mitt Romney will parade his family on stage on the first day of the Republican presidential convention in Florida tomorrow \u2013 all 140 of them. The four-day convention is the biggest event of the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s stuttering bid\u00a0 to become the 45th president of\u00a0 the USA. Chase begins: Mitt Romney (centre) addresses supporters while standing with sons (from left) Matt, Tagg, Craig, wife Ann, Ben and Josh Romney after winning the New Hampshire primary on 10 January 2012 . Four hundred and fifty days into Romney\u2019s campaign, and with just ten weeks to go until the election, the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nomination is struggling to overcome the negative impact of his various gaffes, his apparently contradictory positions on several key issues including healthcare and abortion, and questions about his business career and wealth. Most polls have Barack Obama very slightly ahead, but in real terms the contest is neck and neck. The convention, which is likely to focus on economic issues and will be watched by a TV audience of more than 20\u2009million people, will be the make-or-break moment for Romney because it will mark the point at which the majority of Americans will start to take notice of the presidential campaign. Conventions usually have a significant impact on a candidate\u2019s prospects, and with six out of ten Americans saying they find it impossible to relate to his impassioned defence of traditional values, the former Mormon bishop is pinning his hopes on his family. He calculates that by portraying \u2018Tribe Romney\u2019 as a typically dysfunctional American family, he will win over voters. The family: Michigan Governor George Romney with his wife Lenore and children (left to right) Mitt Romney, G. Scott, Jane and Margo Lynn . Against the backdrop of a tasteful wood-panelled set \u2013 originally built for Oprah Winfrey \u2013 the 65-year-old billionaire will introduce relatives who range from his sister Jane (who was obliged by a failed marriage to take up an acting career) to a brother who was excommunicated for his sexual sins by the Mormon church. \u2018The Romneys are believing Latter-day Saints but they are neither saints nor are they exempt from\u00a0 the influences of the world around them,\u2019 one of his cousins, Ronald Scott, observes in his new biography, Mitt Romney: An Inside Look At The Man And His Politics. Behind the good looks, Scott confides, the family\u2019s attempts to adjust to \u2018pressures and temptations\u2019 make the confessions that will be aired on stage worthy of any reality show. Married to Ann, the blonde granddaughter of a Welsh coalminer, Mitt Romney has five sons and 18 grandchildren, which historians say may make him the most fecund White House candidate ever. Tagg Romney, 42, is Mitt\u2019s oldest son. Like his father, he is an investment banker and so will help emphasise his father\u2019s economic credentials. Tagg and his wife Jennifer have six children, and his four brothers also have families, but three of them \u2018have wrestled with fertility issues,\u2019 says Scott, and resorted to IVF treatment, seemingly inconsistent with their father\u2019s moral views. Showing their support: Mitt's siblings Scott and Jane are set to appear at the convention . \u2018They even employed a fairly compensated surrogate mother,\u2019 claims Scott. He declined to identify which sons but notes that surrogacy is \u2018strongly discouraged\u2019 by the Mormon church, to which all the family belong. Matt Romney, 41, the second son, is a property developer. He and his wife Laurie have four children. The couple irked Mitt\u2019s fellow Republicans last year when they attended a Halloween party dressed as Sarah Palin and her husband Tom. Josh Romney, 37, is considering a political career. The son and his wife Jenn have five children. After serving in England as a Mormon missionary, he became a male model in New York, but Scott says he became disenchanted by the \u2018meat market decadence\u2019. American audiences love a dramatic narrative. Ben Romney, 34, is a doctor. The son and his wife Ande have one child. Ben is said to be the most\u00a0 \u2018un-Romneylike\u2019 of the brothers. Though he has agreed to appear with his family at the convention, he has no interest in politics. Craig Romney, 31, is the youngest son and a former advertising executive. He and wife Mary have two children, one of whom, Parker, is playing a major role in his grandfather\u2019s attempt to soften his image. All to play for: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaks as vice presidential running mate Rep. Paul Ryan listens during a campaign rally . He has repeatedly given interviews about how the four-year-old once fashioned his hair into a mohawk using egg whites and glue. \u2018Man, that was one bad hair day,\u2019 he says. Margo Lynn Keenan, 77, is Romney\u2019s elder sister. She had eight children by her late husband, federal prosecutor Loren Keenan, and the convention will hear she has lived a self-effacing life, devoting herself to the care of her youngest son, who has Down\u2019s syndrome. Lynn has grappled with other difficult issues. Mitt opposes abortion but she is expected to tell the audience he will not \u2018force\u2019 his beliefs on women because her sister-in-law\u00a0 (Loren\u2019s sister) died during a botched backstreet termination. JaneRomney, Mitt\u2019s sister, is expected to reduce the house to tears with a deeply personal story. Now 74, the immaculately preserved bottle blonde dreamed of following her mother, Lenore, into a career as an actress. But she put aside her ambitions to start a family when, aged 20, she married a nephew of Gordon Hinckley, the head prophet of the Mormon church. After more than two decades of marriage, and four children, the couple had an acrimonious divorce.\u00a0 \u2018Family members told me Jane had a terrible divorce,\u2019 said Scott. \u2018It destroyed her life. Her husband had been a terrific philanderer.\u2019 Aged 42, she decided to \u2018resume\u2019 her acting career, although roles have been few. In Florida she is expected to admit to another skeleton in the Romney family closet: she once campaigned for two of California\u2019s best-known Democratic politicians. However, she now says she is a committed Republican. Tight: There's not much in it for the race to be President between Romney and the current premier Barack Obama . \u2018I\u2019ll be at the convention for six or seven days,\u2019 she told The Mail on Sunday. \u2018I have a big story to tell.\u2019Scott Romney, Mitt\u2019s 71-year-old brother, is expected to deliver a frank testimonial about \u2018sin and redemption\u2019, says a party insider. Scott shared his brother\u2019s passion for politics, yearning to follow in the footsteps of their father, George, a millionaire car tycoon and governor of Michigan. But he failed to become Michigan\u2019s chief law officer. He was \u2018sealed for eternity\u2019 in a Mormon temple ceremony to a TV presenter, Ronna Stern. After bringing up six children \u2013 five of their own and hers from a previous marriage \u2013 they divorced in 1992. Later, he was \u2018disfellowshipped\u2019 from the Mormon church when he married Ellen Rogers, a TV host who, in what Scott\u2019s book calls a \u2018religious transgression\u2019, was pregnant with his child. He and Ellen divorced in 2009. In July last year, he married a widow, Sheri Lelalian. First wife, Ronna, now 68, will attend the convention, with Sheri and all seven of his children (including two by Ellen) and their seven grandchildren. It should all make for dramatic viewing. Will it prove to be car-crash TV, dashing Romney\u2019s presidential ambitions? Or a masterstroke that sets his campaign alight?",

Ardrey Kell High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, featured a genetics question in which students were asked to work out the likelihood of a child - LaPrincess - getting 'her mama's big bootie'. Outraged parents question seized upon the question's language, which they said uses racial stereotypes and belittles black people, causing school authorities to withdraw it from tests. 'Racist' question: The item, above, from a genetics quiz, asked students in Charlotte, North Carolina, to work out the likelihood of LaPrincess - daughter to LaShamanda and 'her man' Fontavius - getting a 'big bootie' The question, reported by WBTV, was designed to tests whether the students could understand the difference between a dominant trait, which parents are likely to pass on, and a recessive one, which they are not. It begins: 'LaShamanda has a heterozygous big bootie, the dominant trait. Her man Fontavius has a small bootie which is recesiive. They get married and have a baby named LaPrincess.' After asking students to show their workings, two questions were asked: . The mother of an Ardrey High student said: 'This is not appropriate language at all for the children in the school'. A father whose child goes to the school said: 'It's racist - absolutely - and stereotypical.' An initial response to a parent who complained from an Ardrey High teacher apologized for the offence - but attempted to justify its inclusion by saying students could skip the question and choose another. Outrage: Parents of pupils at Ardrey High (pictured) complained when they read the question, which has been discontinued . However, after renewed complaints the school district distanced itself from the question and said it would be pulled. A statement from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS), which operates Ardrey High, said: 'The worksheet does not appear to be a document created by CMS. 'The school has taken the worksheet out of circulation and requested its teachers to discontinue using it.'",

Rachael Ray visits \"Larry King Live\" on Monday night to give tips on stretching a family's food dollar to the max. CNN's chief business correspondent asked Ray how you can make your meal-time dollars stretch in these tough economic times without sacrificing nutrition or taste. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Ali Velshi: How do we keep from packing on the recession pounds? Tonight, help is on the way. Joining me in New York is Rachael Ray, host of \"The Rachael Ray Show.\" ... We're all kind of stressed right now. We're trying to sort of do more with less and certainly eating in a hurry. You've got some great advice on that. Ray: We need to go back to the way our grandparents prepared food. Instead of buying pieces of chicken, buy a whole chicken. You make that on Sunday, take the leftovers, roll that into fajitas, soups, stews, make your own stock. You've got to start thinking in bigger increments. ... Stock up on lean meats and proteins, on veggies that you know your family likes and turn yourself into your own frozen food factory. Every time that chicken breast goes on sale, stock up. Go home, put it in individual storage bags, pound it out nice and thin. It's a quick defrost.  Watch Rachael Ray's appearance on \"Larry King Live\" \u00bb . Velshi: All right. So you freeze; I like that. You make yourself into your own frozen food factory. Ray: Even with vegetables. ... You know, if broccoli is on a great price this week, buy a ton of it, go home, blanch it a little bit of salted water, cold shock it, put it in a plastic food storage bag, done. Velshi: What's the better deal: Buying your vegetables canned, buying them fresh? Ray: Buying them at a local food market. You know, whether you're in a big city or a small town, farmers markets are your best bargain. You can buy direct from the small producer. And, you know, it's a great way to not only get organic, but get a great price on it. Velshi: Let's talk about takeout food. Parents are trying to save time and money. In many cases, that leads us to fast food, because it's cheap and fast. ... Ray: The food that we can get most readily and at the best bargain isn't good for us. It's processed. I mean all things in moderation. Everybody can have a burger once in a while. Velshi: What do you recommend to our viewers [for fast food]? Ray: Hey, I love a veggie sub at Subway. You know, I think that there is affordable fast food. If you're on the go, fine. Everybody needs to pick up a salad or a burger once in a while. There are healthy choices there. .... If the kids really love fries, tell them they can have a few as long as they eat the veggies, too. And, there are a lot of great strategies you can take with kids in getting them to eat healthier -- little things like switching to whole wheat macaroni, whole wheat pastas. Velshi: It sounds like it's a lot like dealing with the rest of your financial life -- if there's a little bit of planning ahead of time, you can actually save a lot of money. Ray: Absolutely. I think you've got to go into the store armed with a good attitude ... and with coupons. And another really simple thing: When you go grocery shopping, do not look at the price on the product. Look at the unit price. Right there on the shelf, it will tell you the price per ounce or unit of measurement. And that's how you find your truest bargains. Velshi: Let's talk about planning for shopping. When people are trying to trim their bills, what are the biggest mistakes they make? Ray: They go shopping hungry. They make a lot of impulse buys. They shop too many times during the week. ... Try and make that one master list, really think it out and try and plan one day of the week where you can do a big cook. Velshi: Are you a big leftover fan? Ray: Absolutely. But I don't think they should taste like the first time. You know, I'm all for cooking a big chicken and then making chicken chili, chicken pasta. Velshi: Not having roast chicken for four days? Ray: Exactly. Velshi: How do you make that switch if your kids are addicted to  processed and fast food? Ray: Children love good food, and they love being involved. They love feeling like they're helping. If you give children ownership of the meal, if you involve them in the process, they feel like they're problem-solving and it becomes a great self-esteem builder. And for the transition, it can be as simple as taking things that they like, such as macaroni and cheese, and using a whole wheat pasta instead of a plain pasta. Velshi: Do you tell them that you're doing it? Ray: No. I don't think so. Just let them enjoy it. Velshi: What I haven't graduated to is coupons. I get them in the newspaper every week. Is this something we should be looking at now? Ray: This is the perfect time to be using coupons. Whether you're somebody that has [money] or somebody who lives on a very limited budget, it's always fun to get more for your money. Velshi: One of the things in your magazine that I really enjoy is the Supermarket 101 column, just sort of factoids about supermarkets. Ray: Yes. And it gives people neat tips on how to save money when they go shopping. Velshi: Yes. And one of them was about buying in bulk, particularly with nuts. Is that the case for everything? Ray: Everything. When you buy in bulk or you buy a generic name, you have to read the label and make sure that the quality is the same. But, yes, I think it's truly a bargain.",
        "output": "Rachael Ray says we need to go back to way our grandparents prepared food .\nPlan ahead, make large meals and freeze leftovers for later incarnations, Ray says .\nAnother Ray tip: clip coupons before you head to grocery and buy in bulk .\nRay says eat fast food in moderation, pick healthy items such as veggies, salads ."

        "input": "Write highlights for this article for a high school student:\n\nMost wanted: Saudi bomb maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri, who is described by a US official as 'an evil genius' The hunt is on to find Al-Qaeda's 'evil genius' - an explosives expert believed to be behind a terrifying plot to target trans-Atlantic flights using human bombs. Ibrahim Al-Asiri, who has survived numerous assassination attempts, is understood to have perfected a device which can be sewn into a human body making it almost impossible to detect by airport security scanners. The 32-year-old is believed to have led a team of bomb makers based in Yemen which has already produced several of the devices after linking up with extremists fighting in Syria. The technology is already thought to have reached British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It is now feared they will return to target flights leaving the UK. In response, security at airports across . the world is being stepped up after US counter-terror chiefs received . what they described as a 'credible' terror threat. In April this year Al-Asiri survived a US special forces ambush in southern Yemen, when a 4x4 he was believed to be travelling in was targetted in a drone strike and ground assault. Security expert Will Geddes yesterday described Al-Asiri as Al Qaeda's \u2018number one bomb maker.\u2019 He said: \u2018Security experts are worried that there has been more bomb training in some of the terror cells across the Arabian peninsula . \u2018The technology for bomb making is better than it was ten years ago. That makes it easier to share the information. \u2018It could be using a chemical that the scanner doesn't recognise, at a chemical level. \u2018We're talking about objects that are made from innocuous materials, chemicals that slip under the radar. \u2018Think of it as a way to confuse the technology in scanners. It could be the substances in a printer cartridge. \u2018With all the warnings about Al-Asiri, it means airport security teams have to be a lot more vigilant. \u2018As we know there's a lot of linkage between Al Qaeda and this man. He's a constant threat. He's their number one bomb maker. \u2018They have been after him for years. It's believed he has been training other members of Al Qaeda to create devices. He operates across Yemen and the Arabian peninsula.\u2019 In response to the threat, security was . being ramped up at airports across Britain. Passengers at Heathrow were . being asked to switch on laptops and mobile phones to prove they were . functioning properly. In addition, . electronic equipment, clothing and shoes were being swabbed to test for . traces of explosives and the number of sophisticated body scanners at . British airports has been raised from ten to 21. At . Manchester, extra machines were sent to departure gates on . transatlantic flights to allow staff to swab hand luggage at boarding as . well as at security. Electronic devices and footwear are being . subjected to greater scrutiny. The measures are likely to lead to delays during the summer holidays when Heathrow alone has 200,000 passengers a day. British prime minister David Cameron insisted yesterday that safety comes first. He . said: 'This is something we\u2019ve discussed with the Americans and what we . have done is put in place some extra precautions and extra checks. \u2018The safety of the travelling public must come first. We must not take . any risks with that. I hope this won\u2019t lead to unnecessary delays but . it\u2019s very important that we always put safety first.\u2019 Airports . last night insisted planes would not be delayed \u2013 but passengers may . have to arrive at gates earlier to go through the new procedures. Security has been stepped up across airports in Britain with new state-of-the-art scanning equipment being brought in and passengers being warned to expect delays . Al-Asiri's sinister creations have also been used on two high-profile terror attempts in the US, including the underwear bomb carried by Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300 passengers over America on Christmas Day 2009 . 'It has also been suggested that \u2018sky marshals\u2019 \u2013 undercover armed police \u2013 could be brought in on some routes.' Deputy Prime . Minister Nick Clegg warned that the new checks were unlikely to be \u2018a . one-off, temporary thing\u2019. He said: \u2018This is the world we now live in. \u2018I don\u2019t want people to think that this is some sort of blip for a week. 'This . is part of an evolving and constant review about whether the checks in . our airports - and indeed other places of entry and exits from countries . - keep up with what we know from intelligence and other sources about . the nature of the threats we face.\u2019 Al-Asiri's . bombs are of particular concern as they contain no metal elements, . meaning they are virtually undetectable and can evade airport security. Incredibly he carried out one test using his willing younger brother, Abdullah, who had a bomb implanted in his body for an assassination attempt on a Saudi Arabian prince. Although the device went off as planned, Abdullah succeeded in killing only himself and not his target. Al-Asiri\u2019s . sinister creations have also been used on two high-profile terror . attempts in the US, including the underwear bomb carried by Nigerian . Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300 . passengers over America on Christmas Day 2009. In 2010, his devices were found in printer cartridges on a cargo plane bound for the US. They were intercepted in the UK. In . May 2012, US officials said they believed Al-Asiri had built an . improved version of the underwear bomb, which was given to a . Saudi-recruited double agent\u00a0to blow up on a US-bound flight. After . the discovery of the printer cartridge bomb, then US deputy national . security adviser John Brennan said analysis of the devices showed they . were made by the same person who was behind the underwear bomb. In May 2012, US officials said they believed Al-Asiri had built an improved version of the underwear bomb (pictured), which was given to a Saudi-recruited double agent to blow up on a US-bound flight . He . said: \u2018He\u2019s a very dangerous individual \u2013 clearly somebody who has a . fair amount of training and experience. We need to find him and bring . him to justice as soon as we can.\u2019 US . congressman and former homeland security committee chairman Peter King . said Al-Asiri was an \u2018evil genius\u2019, adding: \u2018He is constantly expanding, . he is constantly adjusting.\u2019 Intelligence . sources believe Al-Asiri, who is known as Abu Saleh, has been passing . on his lethal bomb-making expertise from his base in Yemen to Syria, . with plans to attack transatlantic flights. He is also feared to be training British fanatics in Yemen, where MI6 and MI5 believe extremists pose a real threat to the UK. All . his bombs use a chemical fuse and a high-level industrial explosive . known as PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate. The same material was . used in 2001 by British shoe bomber Richard Reid when he tried to . destroy a transatlantic flight. Ben . Friedman, a US expert in defence and homeland security, said the . authorities were worried about bombs implanted inside people or . explosives made from non-metallic elements. But he said it was important to remember that previous attempts to blow up planes had failed. \u2018These . guys are serial failures,\u2019 he added. \u2018It\u2019s not like they have a track . record of unmitigated success. It\u2019s closer to the opposite.\u2019 They surfaced in Yemen in 2009, where it emerged they had joined the newly-formed Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In August of that year, Abdullah pretended to be an Islamist militant who wanted to reform, and was given an audience with Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, Saudi Arabia\u2019s top counter-terrorism official. Once stood next to the royal, he detonated the bomb, hidden inside part of his intestine. But the blast went straight downwards meaning Abdullah was torn in two and the prince escaped with minor injuries. Al-Asiri was named as one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most wanted terrorists in 2009 and in 2011 joined the US wanted list.",
